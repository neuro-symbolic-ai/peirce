    "Given a premise sentence $p_i$, a hypothesis sentence $h_i$, and an explanation $E_i$ consisting of a set of facts $\\{f_1,f_2,...,f_n\\}$, the explanation $E_i$ is considered logically valid if and only if the entailment $p_i \\cup E_i \\models h_i$ holds. This entailment is considered verifiable if $\\{p_i, E_i, h_i\\}$ can be translated into a set of logical formulae $\\Phi$ that compose a theory $\\Theta$. The validity of the theory $\\Theta$ is subsequently determined by a theorem prover, verifying whether $\\Theta \\vDash \\psi$, where $\\psi$ represents a logical consequence derived from the logical form of $h_i$.\n",
