(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation, then the mutation is specifically located in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ⟶ (Located e ∧ Specific e ∧ In e y ∧ CTNNB y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB y"
