(* Explanation 1: BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y. Regulation e ∧ BRAF x ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ Influences e ∧ CellDivision e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
 shows "∃e x y. BRAF x ∧ Regulation e ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ Influences e ∧ Role e ∧ CellDivision e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by auto
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF's regulation influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  obtain e x y where "Regulation e ∧ BRAF x ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ Influences e ∧ CellDivision e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e"
    using explanation_1 by blast
  (* We can rearrange the obtained information to match the hypothesis structure. *)
  then have "BRAF x ∧ Regulation e ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ Influences e ∧ Role e ∧ CellDivision e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
