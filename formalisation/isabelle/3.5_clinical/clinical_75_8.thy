(* Explanation 1: The activating mutation PIK3Ca is specifically implied by the activation of the PI3K pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PIK3Ca x ⟶ ImpliedBy x (ActivationOf PI3KPathway)"

(* Explanation 2: The activating mutation PIK3Ca is known and frequent in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. PIK3Ca x ⟶ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3Ca x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(activating mutation PIK3Ca, known and frequent in breast cancer) *)
  (* We can infer that PIK3Ca x implies it is known and frequent in breast cancer. *)
  then have "Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" using explanation_2 by presburger
  (* Since PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation, we can conclude that it is an activating mutation. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
