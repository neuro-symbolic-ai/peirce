(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (HomologousRecombinationRepair x)"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ ReplacedBy x (DamagedDNA x) (UndamagedHomologousMolecules x) ∧ From x (SisterChromatids x) ∧ From x (PaternalCopiesOfChromosomes x) ∧ From x (MaternalCopiesOfChromosomes x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA break repair via homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x) ∧ Via x (HomologousRecombinationRepair x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (HomologousRecombinationRepair x)" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition A: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We can use the implication from the explanation sentence 1. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* We also know that homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process. *)
  (* We have the logical proposition B: homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* We can use the implication from the explanation sentence 2. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is involved in double strand break DNA repair process. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ⟶ InvolvedIn x x (DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x)" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can conclude that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA break repair via homologous recombination repair. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
