(* Explanation 1: The initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. InitialChemotherapyTreatment x ∧ Patient y ⟶ FirstLineChemotherapy x ∧ IdentifiedAs x FirstLineChemotherapy"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient' e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition, specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that if the patient has received first-line chemotherapy, then the initial chemotherapy treatment is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient' e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
