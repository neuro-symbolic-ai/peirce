(* Explanation 1: Being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase implies being a proto-oncogene. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. RASRegulated x ∧ Cytoplasmic x ∧ SerineThreonineKinase x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is a proto-oncogene, it plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Entity x ∧ ProtoOncogene x ⟶ (PlaysRoles e ∧ Regulating e x MAPKERK)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
 shows "ProtoOncogene x ∧ ∃e. PlaysRoles e ∧ Regulating e x MAPKERK"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that implies being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase leads to being a proto-oncogene. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase, Being a proto-oncogene) *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF x being a proto-oncogene. *)
  then have "ProtoOncogene x" <ATP>
  (* We also have an explanatory sentence that if an entity is a proto-oncogene, it plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(Being a proto-oncogene, Playing important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* Since BRAF x is a proto-oncogene, it plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "∃e. PlaysRoles e ∧ Regulating e x MAPKERK" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
