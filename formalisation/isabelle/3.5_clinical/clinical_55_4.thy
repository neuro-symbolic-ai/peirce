(* Explanation 1: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PathogenicMutation y ∧ In y PALB2"

(* Explanation 2: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient y ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ To e ∧ Links e ∧ In e Humans"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ Joining y ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules y ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ In e Humans"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
 shows "∃e x y. Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e ∧ In e HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the loss, PALB2, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Loss e" and "PALB2 x" and "BRCA2 y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2, BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans) *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  then have "BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis states that the loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), Implies(Not(BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans), Not(Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2)) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
