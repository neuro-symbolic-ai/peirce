(* Explanation 1: If an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 3: The activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Patient x ∧ SeenFrequently y BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y ∧ SeenFrequently y BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the entity x is a patient and entity y has an activating PIK3Ca mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y" by auto
  (* There are relevant explanatory sentences that connect the presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient to being known and located in breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(D, C) to infer that the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* Since we have Patient x and ActivatingMutation y, we can infer Known x and LocatedIn x BreastCancer. *)
  then have "Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  (* There is also a logical relation Implies(D, E) that connects the presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient to being frequently seen in breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* Given that we have Patient x and ActivatingMutation y, we can infer SeenFrequently y BreastCancer. *)
  then have "SeenFrequently y BreastCancer" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the above inferences with the premise to derive the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
