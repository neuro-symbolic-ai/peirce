(* Explanation 1: The interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors licensed for use in prostate cancer patients leads to the existence of two potential treatment options for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Olaparib x ∧ Rucaparib y ∧ PARP1Inhibitor z ∧ ProstateCancerPatient z ∧ LeadsTo e ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y"

(* Explanation 2: The patient having access to Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors implies that there are two potential treatment options available for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Olaparib x ∧ Rucaparib y ∧ PARP1Inhibitor z ∧ PatientHavingAccess e ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TreatmentOption y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(patient having access to Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors, two potential treatment options available for the patient) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2, we can infer the existence of two potential treatment options. *)
  then obtain a b where "Patient x ∧ TreatmentOption a ∧ TreatmentOption b" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
