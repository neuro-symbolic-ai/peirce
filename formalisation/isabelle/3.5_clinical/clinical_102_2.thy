(* Explanation 1: Lapatinib and neratinib bind to the HER2 kinase domain and are therefore expected to have efficacy against tumors with these mutations in the kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Lapatinib x ∧ Neratinib y ∧ HER2KinaseDomain z ∧ Bind e ∧ To e x z ∧ To e y z ∧ Efficacy e ∧ Against e z"

(* Explanation 2: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain may overcome treatment resistance and be effective in breast cancer patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. IrreversibleInhibitor x ∧ TargetedTo e ∧ To e x z ∧ Overcome e ∧ TreatmentResistance e ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatients e y ∧ BreastCancerPatients y"

(* Explanation 3: ERBB2 V777L is an inclusion criterion in 4 clinical trials for breast carcinoma, of which 4 are open and 0 are closed. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. InclusionCriterion e ∧ ForClinicalTrials e x y ∧ ClinicalTrials e 4 ∧ Open e 4 ∧ Closed e 0"

(* Explanation 4: Of the trials that contain ERBB2 V777L and breast carcinoma as inclusion criteria, 1 is phase 1/phase 2 (1 open) and 3 are phase 2 (3 open). *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. Contain e ∧ Trials e x y ∧ Phase1Phase2 e 1 ∧ Open e 1 ∧ Phase2 e 3 ∧ Open e 3"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients may benefit from treatment with Neratinib or Lapatinib or may be able to access a clinical trial for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
 shows "∃x e1 e2 e3. Patient x ∧ (Benefit e1 ∧ WithTreatment e1 x Neratinib) ∨ (Benefit e2 ∧ WithTreatment e2 x Lapatinib) ∨ (Access e3 ∧ ClinicalTrial e3 ∧ ForTreatment e3 x y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* We have the logical proposition that Lapatinib and neratinib bind to the HER2 kinase domain and are expected to have efficacy against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A and B, C), Implies(expected efficacy against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain, an irreversible inhibitor targeted to the HER2 kinase domain) *)
  (* We can infer that Lapatinib and neratinib are effective in breast cancer patients. *)
  then have "Effective e" sledgehammer
  (* We also have the logical proposition that ERBB2 V777L is an inclusion criterion in clinical trials for breast carcinoma. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(F, J), Equivalent(ERBB2 V777L is an inclusion criterion in clinical trials for breast carcinoma, trials contain ERBB2 V777L and breast carcinoma as inclusion criteria) *)
  (* We can conclude that trials contain ERBB2 V777L and breast carcinoma as inclusion criteria. *)
  then have "Trials e x y" <ATP>
  (* Since the patient can benefit from treatment with Neratinib or Lapatinib, we can derive the final conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
