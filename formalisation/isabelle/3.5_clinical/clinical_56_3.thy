(* Explanation 1: Patient with PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ PALB2c x"

(* Explanation 2: 1592delT mutated Breast Cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "Mutated `1592delT` ∧ BreastCancer `BreastCancer`"

(* Explanation 3: PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "PALB2c `PALB2c`"

(* Explanation 4: 1592delT is a pathogenic mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y. `1592delT` x ∧ PathogenicMutation y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y)"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y) ∧ PALB2(y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a pathogenic mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(1592delT mutated Breast Cancer, 1592delT is a pathogenic mutation) *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 2, C is from explanatory sentence 4. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient has a pathogenic mutation in PALB2. *)
  then have "Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ PALB2(y)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
