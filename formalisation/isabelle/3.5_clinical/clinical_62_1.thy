(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 being a human gene implies that BRCA2 protein is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanGene x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR (ProteinOf x))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
 (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
 shows "∃x. HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 being a human gene, BRCA2 protein is involved in HRR) *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentence to infer that BRCA2 protein is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "HumanGene x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR (ProteinOf x)" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer that there exists a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  then have "∃x. HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
