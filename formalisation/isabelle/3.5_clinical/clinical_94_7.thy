(* Explanation 1: Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. AdultSponges x ⟶ (∃e y z. Eggs y ∧ Sperm z ∧ Produce e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z)"

(* Explanation 2: Sperm and eggs are cells known as gametes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Sperm x ∧ Eggs y ⟶ Gametes x ∧ Gametes y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "True"
  shows "∃x y. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Unavailable x y ∧ ForPatient y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have no additional information provided. *)

  (* We know that the unavailability of the combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor for a patient implies that the patient's treatment plan specifically includes both vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(certain combination of treatments, specifically vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor is unavailable for a patient, patient's treatment plan specifically includes both vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient's treatment plan includes both vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor. *)
  have "∃x y. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Unavailable x y ∧ ForPatient y" sledgehammer
