(* Explanation 1: Defective homologous recombination repair being involved implies the repair mechanisms are also involved in response to double strand breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ Involved y ∧ RepairMechanisms z ∧ ResponseTo z DoubleStrandBreaks ⟶ Involved x ∧ Involved z"

(* Explanation 2: The involvement of defective homologous recombination repair triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ InvolvementOf x ∧ Triggers e ∧ DirectCausalRelationship y ∧ With e x RepairMechanisms ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ Preventing e ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RelyingOn e z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair z ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining z ∧ Repairing z y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks. *)
  (* This implies that single strand break repair is prevented. *)
  have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y" by (rule asm)
  (* We have the logical proposition that Defective homologous recombination repair being involved implies the repair mechanisms are also involved in response to double strand breaks. *)
  (* This means that if Defective homologous recombination repair is involved, repair mechanisms are also involved in response to double strand breaks. *)
  (* Since PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks, we can infer that repair mechanisms are involved. *)
  have "Involved RepairMechanisms" <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical proposition that the involvement of defective homologous recombination repair triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms. *)
  (* This implies that if defective homologous recombination repair is involved, it triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms. *)
  (* Since PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks, and defective homologous recombination repair is involved, it triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms. *)
  have "DirectCausalRelationship y" <ATP>
  (* Now, we can combine the information to prove the hypothesis. *)
