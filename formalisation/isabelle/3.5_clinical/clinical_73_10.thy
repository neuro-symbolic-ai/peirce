(* Explanation 1: If an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Has x y ∧ Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. ActivatingMutation y ∧ Patient x ∧ Has x y ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 3: The activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequently y BreastCancer"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y ∧ SeenFrequently y BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has an activating PIK3Ca mutation y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* We can infer that the activating PIK3Ca mutation y is seen frequently in breast cancer tissue. *)
  from explanation_3 obtain z where "SeenFrequently y z" and "z = BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that if an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient x is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y› have "Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information, we can derive that there exist x and y such that the patient x has an activating PIK3Ca mutation y, and it is seen frequently in breast cancer tissue. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y ∧ SeenFrequently y BreastCancer" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
