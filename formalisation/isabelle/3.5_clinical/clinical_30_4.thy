(* Explanation 1: For any event e, inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations if and only if it inhibits β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation y ⟷ InhibitBetaCatenin e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation y"
 (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
 shows "∃e x. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has an activating CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient y ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation y" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, inhibits β-catenin) *)
  (* We can derive Implies(B, A), Implies(inhibits β-catenin, inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations) *)
  (* Since the patient has an activating CTNNB1 mutation, inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating them. *)
  then have "InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e" for e
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
