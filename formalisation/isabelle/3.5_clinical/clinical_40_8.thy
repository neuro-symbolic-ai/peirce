(* Explanation 1: For any patient x with hepatoblastoma, there exists an activating mutation z in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x ⟶ (∃z. ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ DirectlyLinked z x ∧ ConditionOf x Hepatoblastoma)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about the patient x with hepatoblastoma. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states for any patient x with hepatoblastoma, there exists an activating mutation z in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  (* This implies that there exists an activating mutation y in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of an activating mutation y in CTNNB1 for the patient x. *)
  then have "∃y. ActivatingMutation y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ ConditionOf x Hepatoblastoma" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Since the activating mutation y is in CTNNB1, we can conclude that there exists a patient x with the activating mutation y in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ ConditionOf x Hepatoblastoma" using assms by blast
