(* Explanation 1: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Required e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ LocalizationOf e ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ SitesOfDNA z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ SitesOfDNA z ∧ Links e ∧ InRepair e ∧ InDamage e ∧ HRRepair z ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ BRCA1 z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information that PALB2 encodes a binding partner. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y" by auto
  (* We know from the explanatory sentence that PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2, PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer that PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  then have "PALB2 x" ∧ "BindingPartner y" ∧ "Localises e" ∧ "Agent e x" ∧ "Patient e z" ∧ "SitesOfDNA z" ∧ "Links e" ∧ "InRepair e" ∧ "InDamage e" ∧ "HRRepair z" ∧ "BRCA2 z" ∧ "BRCA1 z" sledgehammer
