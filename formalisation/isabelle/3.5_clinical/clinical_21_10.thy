(* Explanation 1: The mutation W25_H36del is the specific mutation that causes the activating mutation in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Mutation x ∧ SpecificMutation y ∧ Causes y ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ In y CTNNB"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a specific mutation. *)
  have "Patient x" by (simp add: assms)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we have the relation between SpecificMutation and ActivatingMutation in CTNNB. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "∃y. ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
