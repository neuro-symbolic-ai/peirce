(* Explanation 1: The detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of single strand DNA damage directly result in its involvement in the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. DetectionBindingPARP1 x ∧ SitesSingleStrandDNA y ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ RecognitionRepairDNA z ∧ Directly e ∧ Result e"

(* Explanation 2: Add a statement that explicitly connects the detection and binding of PARP1 to its role in DNA damage recognition and repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. AddStatement x ∧ Connects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DetectionBindingPARP1 y ∧ RoleDNARepair z ∧ Patient e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ RecognitionRepairDNA y ∧ SingleStrand y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in single strand DNA damage repair. *)
 shows "∃x y. PARP1 x ∧ RecognitionRepairDNA y ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ SingleStrand y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PARP1, RecognitionRepairDNA, and SingleStrand. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" and "RecognitionRepairDNA y" and "SingleStrand y" apply simp
  
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that the detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of single strand DNA damage directly result in its involvement in the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of single strand DNA damage, involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer the involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
  then have "Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We have all the necessary components to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
