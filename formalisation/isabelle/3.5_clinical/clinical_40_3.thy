(* Explanation 1: If a patient has hepatoblastoma and there is a specific entity related to the patient with CTNNB1 W25_H36del, then that entity has an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Related z x ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ W25_H36del z ⟶ (Entity e ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutation e ∧ In z e)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient implies the presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Related z x ⟶ (Entity e ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutation e ∧ In z e ∧ CTNNB1 e)"

(* Explanation 3: The activating mutation in CTNNB1 is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Mutation x ∧ Activating x ∧ In y x ∧ CTNNB1 x ⟶ (Patient y ∧ Condition y hepatoblastoma)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a mutation and the mutation is activating. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(D), Not(A)), Implies(Not(presence of activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity), Not(patient has hepatoblastoma)) *)
  (* By contraposition, if the patient does not have hepatoblastoma, there is no presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity. *)
  (* Since the patient has an activating mutation, it implies the patient has hepatoblastoma. *)
  then have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(patient has hepatoblastoma, presence of activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity) *)
  (* Given that the patient has hepatoblastoma, there is a presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity. *)
  then have "∃z e. Entity e ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutation e ∧ In z e ∧ CTNNB1 e" sledgehammer
