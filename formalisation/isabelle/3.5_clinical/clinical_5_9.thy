(* Explanation 1: Specify that the occurrence of event e directly implies the inhibition of PARP x *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Event e ∧ Implies e x ∧ Directly e ∧ InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ Implies e x"

(* Explanation 2: Clarify that the presence of event e leads to the inhibition of PARP x *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Event e ∧ Leads e x ∧ To e ∧ InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ Leads e x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break *)
 shows "∃x y z e. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DoubleStrandBreak z ∧ Results e ∧ In e x ∧ In e y ∧ In e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that InhibitionOfPARP x is true. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x" by blast
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences that relate to the inhibition of PARP x. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations to infer that the occurrence of event e directly implies the inhibition of PARP x. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(occurrence of event e, inhibition of PARP x) *)
  (* Both A and B are from the explanatory sentences. *)
  (* We can infer the occurrence of event e from the inhibition of PARP x. *)
  then have "Event e" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* The hypothesis states that Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break. *)
  (* We need to show that there exist y and z such that CollapsedReplicationForks y and DoubleStrandBreak z. *)
  (* We also need to show that there exists an event e that results in the inhibition of PARP x and involves x, y, and z. *)
  (* We can use the known information and the derived implications to infer the required components. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DoubleStrandBreak z ∧ Results e ∧ In e x ∧ In e y ∧ In e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
