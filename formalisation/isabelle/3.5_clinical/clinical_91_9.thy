(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is related to the manner in which e acts *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ (RecoveryProcess e ∧ RelatedTo e (MannerOfActing e))"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ (RecoveryProcess e ∧ Role e x DNARepair)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitors e"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃e. Inhibitors e ∧ Target e TumourSpecificDefects ∧ Defects TumourSpecificDefects ∧ DNARepair TumourSpecificDefects ∧ Role e TumourSpecificDefects DNARepair ∧ RecoverFrom e DNARepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that e is related to Inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors e" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 which are relevant to the recovery process and the role of PARP1 in DNA repair. *)
  (* There are logical relations Implies(A, B) and Implies(A, C) *)
  (* We can infer the recovery process related to the manner of acting and the role of PARP1 in DNA repair. *)
  then have "RecoveryProcess e ∧ RelatedTo e (MannerOfActing e) ∧ Role e e DNARepair" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis involves Target, Defects, and RecoverFrom related to TumourSpecificDefects. *)
  (* We need to introduce a new constant for TumourSpecificDefects. *)
  obtain TumourSpecificDefects where "True" <ATP>
  (* We can now combine the known information and inferred relations to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Inhibitors e ∧ Target e TumourSpecificDefects ∧ Defects TumourSpecificDefects ∧ DNARepair TumourSpecificDefects ∧ Role e TumourSpecificDefects DNARepair ∧ RecoverFrom e DNARepair" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
