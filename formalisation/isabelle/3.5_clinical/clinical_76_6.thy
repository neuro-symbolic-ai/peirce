(* Explanation 1: The catalysis of the p110 subunit in converting PIP2 to PIP3 directly leads to the conversion of PIP2 to PIP *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. CatalysisOfP110Subunit e ∧ Leads e ∧ Conversion e ∧ ConversionOf e PIP2 PIP"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "P110SubunitOfPIK3 x"
  (* Hypothesis: The p110 subunit of PIK3 catalyses the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 and mediates recruitment of PI3K to plasma membrane *)
 shows "∃e. P110SubunitOfPIK3 e ∧ CatalysisOfP110Subunit e ∧ Conversion e ∧ ConversionOf e PIP2 PIP3 ∧ Mediates e ∧ Recruitment e ∧ RecruitmentOf e PI3K ∧ PlasmaMembrane e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the p110 subunit of PIK3 is x. *)
  from asm have "P110SubunitOfPIK3 x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating the relation between the catalysis of the p110 subunit and the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. *)
  (* We can infer that if the p110 subunit catalyses the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3, it leads to the conversion of PIP2 to PIP. *)
  (* This implies the existence of an event e that satisfies the conditions. *)
  obtain e where "CatalysisOfP110Subunit e ∧ Leads e ∧ Conversion e ∧ ConversionOf e PIP2 PIP" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the known information and the derived implications to conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then have "P110SubunitOfPIK3 e ∧ CatalysisOfP110Subunit e ∧ Conversion e ∧ ConversionOf e PIP2 PIP3 ∧ Mediates e ∧ Recruitment e ∧ RecruitmentOf e PI3K ∧ PlasmaMembrane e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
