(* Explanation 1: If a patient has TNBC, and they undergo first-line treatment with chemotherapy, and they had a stable disease after the treatment, then it implies that the patient had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC y ∧ FirstLineTreatmentWithChemotherapy z ∧ Undergo e1 x z ∧ HadStableDisease e2 ∧ After e2 z ⟶ HadStableDiseaseAfterFirstLineTreatment e1 x"

(* Explanation 2: Add an explanatory sentence specifying that if a patient has TNBC, then they are considered for specific treatments tailored for TNBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC y ⟶ ConsideredForSpecificTreatments x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ConsideredFor y x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, E), Implies(patient has TNBC, considered for specific treatments tailored for TNBC) *)
  (* We can infer that if the patient has TNBC, they are considered for specific treatments tailored for TNBC. *)
  then have "ConsideredForSpecificTreatments x y" for some y sledgehammer
  (* Since the patient is considered for specific treatments tailored for TNBC, we can conclude that they are considered for second-line treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ConsideredFor y x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y" for some y <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
