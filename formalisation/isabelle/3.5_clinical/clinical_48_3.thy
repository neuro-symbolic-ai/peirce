(* Explanation 1: Inhibition of PARP prevents the occurrence of SS breaks. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. InhibitionOfPARP e ∧ Prevents e ∧ OccurrenceOfSSBreaks e"

(* Explanation 2: The absence of SS breaks leads to the absence of HRR activation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. AbsenceOfSSBreaks e ⟶ AbsenceOfHRRAcivation e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP e"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
 shows "∃e. InhibitionOfPARP e ∧ Results e ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DSB e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the inhibition of PARP. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP e" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that inhibition of PARP prevents the occurrence of SS breaks. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(Inhibition of PARP, Not(occurrence of SS breaks)) *)
  (* Since Inhibition of PARP is true, we can infer Not(occurrence of SS breaks). *)
  (* Not(occurrence of SS breaks) implies the absence of SS breaks. *)
  (* The absence of SS breaks leads to the absence of HRR activation according to another explanatory sentence. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, Not(D)), Implies(absence of SS breaks, Not(absence of HRR activation)) *)
  (* Therefore, from the absence of SS breaks, we can infer the absence of HRR activation. *)
  then have "AbsenceOfHRRAcivation e" sledgehammer
  (* The absence of HRR activation implies the absence of DSB. *)
  then have "DSB e" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the known information to conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
