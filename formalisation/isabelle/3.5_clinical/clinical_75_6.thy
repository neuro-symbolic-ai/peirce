(* Explanation 1: The activation of the PI3K pathway implies an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Activation e PI3KPathway ⟶ (∃x. ActivatingMutation x ∧ Implies e x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "ActivatingMutation x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about an activating mutation. *)
  from asm have "ActivatingMutation x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(activation of the PI3K pathway, activating mutation) *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentence to infer that the activation of the PI3K pathway implies an activating mutation. *)
  (* Since we have an activating mutation, we can conclude that the PI3K pathway is activated. *)
  have "Activation e PI3KPathway" for some e sledgehammer
  (* From the activation of the PI3K pathway, we can infer that there exists an activating mutation. *)
  then obtain y where "ActivatingMutation y ∧ Implies e y" <ATP>
  (* Since PIK3Ca is a known activating mutation, we can deduce that it is known and frequent. *)
  then have "Known PIK3Ca ∧ Frequent PIK3Ca" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can conclude that PIK3Ca is in breast cancer. *)
  then have "In PIK3Ca BreastCancer" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
