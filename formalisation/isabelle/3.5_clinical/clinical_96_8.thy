(* Explanation 1: If a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, then the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Has z ∧ V600E_Mutation z ⟶ (Receiving e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ With z x)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib, then the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Receiving y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib z ⟶ (Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600E_Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600E_Mutation z ∧ Receiving e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ With z x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a V600E mutation and is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600E_Mutation z" <ATP>
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(B, A) to infer that if the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib, then the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* This relation is derived from Explanation 2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "Patient x ∧ Receiving z ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z" <ATP>
  (* Now, we have the necessary information to show that the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib for the V600E mutation. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
