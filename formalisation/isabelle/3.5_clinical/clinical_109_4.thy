(* Explanation 1: The presence implies the amplification of HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Presence x ∧ Implies y ∧ Amplification y HER ⟶ ImpliesPresence x y"

(* Explanation 2: The mutation V777L in HER2 is a type of mutation that leads to HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Mutation x (V777L HER2) ∧ TypeOfMutation x y ∧ LeadsToAmplification y z ∧ Amplified z HER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Amplification e HER2 ∧ Mutation e (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified e HER2 ∧ BreastCancer e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the mutation V777L in HER2 is a type of mutation that leads to HER2 amplification. *)
  (* This implies that if there is a mutation V777L in HER2, it leads to HER2 amplification. *)
  (* We can infer that there exists an entity e such that there is a mutation e (V777L HER2) and it is amplified HER2. *)
  then have "∃e. Mutation e (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified e HER2" <ATP>
  (* Now, we need to connect the patient to the mutation and amplification. *)
  (* Since the patient has the mutation and amplification, we can add the patient to the existing entity e. *)
  then have "∃e. Patient x ∧ Mutation e (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified e HER2" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can add that the entity e also has breast cancer. *)
  then have "∃e. Patient x ∧ Mutation e (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified e HER2 ∧ BreastCancer e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
