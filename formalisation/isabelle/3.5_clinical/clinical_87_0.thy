(* Explanation 1: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PD1Inhibitors x ∧ PDL1Inhibitors x ⟶ CheckpointInhibitorAnticancerDrugs x"

(* Explanation 2: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs have started to make progress in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with promising outcomes both in the early and the metastatic setting. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PD1PDL1Drugs x ∧ TNBC y ∧ Early z ∧ Metastatic z ∧ Progress e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ With e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PD1Inhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ TNBC z"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PD-1 inhibitors, promising outcomes, and TNBC. *)
  from asm have "PD1Inhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ TNBC z" by simp
  
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
  (* This implies that PD1Inhibitors x and PDL1Inhibitors x are checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
  (* However, this information is not directly relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs have made progress in TNBC with promising outcomes. *)
  (* This information is directly related to the hypothesis. *)
  (* We can infer that PD1PDL1Drugs x are immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x" sledgehammer
  
  (* We also have information about promising outcomes and TNBC from the premise. *)
  (* Therefore, we can include these in the final conclusion. *)
  then have "PromisingOutcomes y ∧ TNBC z" <ATP>
  
  (* We need to show that there exists an event where the agent is x, the patient is y, and the event is related to z. *)
  (* This aligns with the 'Had' relation in the hypothesis. *)
  (* We can introduce a new event e that satisfies the conditions. *)
  then obtain e where "Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ With e z" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining all the information, we have the elements required for the conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
