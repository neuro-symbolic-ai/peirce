(* Explanation 1: If a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then the treatment involving the Notch inhibitor is not available for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ EffectiveFor y x ⟶ NotAvailableFor y x"

(* Explanation 2: If a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then there are no licensed Notch inhibitors available *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ EffectiveFor y x ⟶ ¬(∃z. Licensed z ∧ NotchInhibitor z)"

(* Explanation 3: If a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then there are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for pediatric patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ EffectiveFor y x ⟶ ¬(∃z. InClinicalTrials z ∧ ForPediatricPatients z)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Treatment x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: This treatment is not available for this patient *)
  shows "∃x y. Treatment x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotAvailableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the treatment and the patient. *)
  from asm have "Treatment x" and "Patient y" <ATP>
  (* We know that if a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then the treatment involving the Notch inhibitor is not available for that patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, the treatment involving the Notch inhibitor is not available for that patient) *)
  (* Since we have the treatment x and patient y, we can infer that the treatment is not available for the patient. *)
  then have "NotAvailableFor x y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists x and y such that the treatment x is not available for the patient y. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
