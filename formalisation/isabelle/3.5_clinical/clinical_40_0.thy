(* Explanation 1: Patient hepatoblastoma with CTNNB1 W25_H36del *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. PatientHepatoblastoma x ∧ With x y ∧ CTNNB1 y ∧ W25_H36del y"

(* Explanation 2: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CTNNB1 x ∧ W25_H36del x ⟶ ActivatingMutation x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PatientHepatoblastoma x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In(x, y)"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ ActivatingMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y) ∧ CTNNB1(y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about the patient having hepatoblastoma and an activating mutation. *)
  from asm have "PatientHepatoblastoma x ∧ ActivatingMutation y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states Patient hepatoblastoma with CTNNB1 W25_H36del. *)
  (* This relates to the logical proposition A: Patient has hepatoblastoma and B: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
  (* We can infer CTNNB1 W25_H36del from the known information. *)
  then obtain z where "With x z ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ W25_H36del z" sledgehammer
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
  (* This relates to the logical proposition B: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
  (* Since we have CTNNB1 z and W25_H36del z, we can infer ActivatingMutation z. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation z" <ATP>
  (* We have all the necessary information to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
