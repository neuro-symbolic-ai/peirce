(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is involved in the process of HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ InvolvedInProcess x HRR"

(* Explanation 2: InvolvedIn(x, HRR) *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedIn x HRR"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHRR x Humans"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in the process of HRR. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x where "BRCA2 x ∧ InvolvedInProcess x HRR" by blast
  (* We are given that BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x. *)
  (* Since BRCA2 x is involved in the process of HRR, we can infer that x is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x HRR" by (simp add: explanation_2)
  (* Since x is involved in HRR and HRR is a process in which humans are involved, we can conclude that x is involved in HRR in humans. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR x Humans" sledgehammer
