(* Explanation 1: If a certain combination of treatments, specifically vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for a patient, then it implies that there is an event specifically for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Patient e ∧ UnavailableFor x y e ⟶ EventForPatient e"

(* Explanation 2: The unavailability of the combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor for a patient indicates that the event is tailored for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Unavailability x ∧ Combination y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Patient e ∧ TailoredForPatient e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
 shows "∃x y z. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ UnavailableFor x y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by simp
  (* We can use explanatory sentence 1 to infer that if the combination is unavailable for a patient, there is an event for that patient. *)
  (* Since we have the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor, we can infer that there is an event for the patient. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "EventForPatient e" sledgehammer
  (* Now, we can use explanatory sentence 2 which states that if the combination is unavailable, the event is tailored for the patient. *)
  (* Therefore, if the combination is unavailable, it is tailored for the patient. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "TailoredForPatient e" <ATP>
  (* Since the event is tailored for the patient, we can conclude that the combination is unavailable for the patient. *)
  then have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ UnavailableFor x y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
