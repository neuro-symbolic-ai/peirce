(* Explanation 1: the B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) is a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRAF x ⟶ RASRegulated x ∧ Cytoplasmic x ∧ SerineThreonineKinase x"

(* Explanation 2: BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. BRAF x ∧ PlayRoles e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
 shows "ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. PlayRoles e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by auto
  (* BRAF is related to logical proposition A and B. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states Implies(A, B), which means if BRAF is a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase, then it plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* Since we have BRAF x, we can infer that it is a proto-oncogene and plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. PlayRoles e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK)" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
