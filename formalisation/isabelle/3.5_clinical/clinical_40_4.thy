(* Explanation 1: If this patient has hepatoblastoma, then there is a related entity with an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ In x y ⟶ (∃w. RelatedEntity w ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In w z ∧ CTNNB1 z)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in this patient implies the presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Hepatoblastoma x ∧ Patient y ∧ In y x ⟶ (∃w. RelatedEntity w ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In w z ∧ CTNNB1 z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is related to hepatoblastoma. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states if a patient has hepatoblastoma, then there is a related entity with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of a related entity with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then obtain w z where "RelatedEntity w ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In w z ∧ CTNNB1 z" sledgehammer
  (* We have found the related entity w with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In w z ∧ CTNNB1 z" by auto
  then show ?thesis by auto
