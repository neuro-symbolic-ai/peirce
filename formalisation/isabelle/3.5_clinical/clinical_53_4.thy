(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 is equivalent to BRCA2 not being functional *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. LossOfBRCA2 x ⟶ ¬Functional BRCA2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ∧ NHEJRepairProcesses z"
 (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to NHEJ repair processes *)
 shows "∃x y z e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ∧ NHEJRepairProcesses z ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DefaultTo e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about Loss of BRCA2, Cell, and NHEJ Repair Processes. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x" and "Cell y" and "NHEJRepairProcesses z" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2, BRCA2 not being functional) *)
  (* We can use the derived implication Implies(B, A) to infer Loss of BRCA2 from BRCA2 not being functional. *)
  (* Since Loss of BRCA2 is equivalent to BRCA2 not being functional, we can conclude Loss of BRCA2 from the premise. *)
  then have "BRCA2 not being functional" apply (simp add: assms)
  then have "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ∧ NHEJRepairProcesses z ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DefaultTo e z" by (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
