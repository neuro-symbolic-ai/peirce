(* Explanation 1: PARP1 is a poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase, which modifies various nuclear proteins by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PARP1 x ⟶ (PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ (∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ InvolvedIn e VariousNuclearProteins))"

(* Explanation 2: Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation… is dependent on DNA and is involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and tumor transformation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. PolyADPribosylation x ⟶ (DependentOn x DNA ∧ InvolvedIn x Regulation ∧ InvolvedIn x CellularProcesses ∧ InvolvedIn x Differentiation ∧ InvolvedIn x Proliferation ∧ InvolvedIn x TumorTransformation)"

(* Explanation 3: Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation… is involved in… the regulation of the molecular events involved in the recovery of cell from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. PolyADPribosylation x ⟶ (InvolvedIn x Regulation ∧ InvolvedIn x MolecularEvents ∧ InvolvedIn x RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferse which, via polyADP-riosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
 shows "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ ∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ InvolvedIn e VariousNuclearProteins ∧ InvolvedIn e CellularProcesses ∧ InvolvedIn e RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP1 is related to PolyADPribosylTransferse and modifies various nuclear proteins. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" <ATP>
  (* Using Explanation 1, we can infer that PARP1 is a PolyADPribosylTransferse and modifies various nuclear proteins. *)
  then have "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ (∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ InvolvedIn e VariousNuclearProteins)" <ATP>
  (* We need to show that the event is involved in CellularProcesses and RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage. *)
  (* Using Explanation 2, we know that PolyADPribosylation is involved in CellularProcesses. *)
  then have "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ (∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ InvolvedIn e VariousNuclearProteins ∧ InvolvedIn e CellularProcesses)" <ATP>
  (* Using Explanation 3, we know that PolyADPribosylation is involved in RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage. *)
  then have "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ (∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ InvolvedIn e VariousNuclearProteins ∧ InvolvedIn e CellularProcesses ∧ InvolvedIn e RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
