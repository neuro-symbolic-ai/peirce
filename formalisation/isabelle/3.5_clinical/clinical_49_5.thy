(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor in driving cancer development through a specific event e. The event e2, where loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, involves both driving cancer development and genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e1 ∧ Factor e1 ∧ In e1 (Driving CancerDevelopment) ∧ Through e1 e2 ∧ Where e2 (Factor LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction) ∧ Involves e2 (Driving CancerDevelopment) ∧ Involves e2 GenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
  shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e ∧ Driving e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e holds. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e" <ATP>
  (* Given the explanation sentence, we have that there exists events e1 and e2 such that LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e1 is a factor in driving cancer development and e2 involves both driving cancer development and genomic instability. *)
  (* We can instantiate e1 as e to match the premise. *)
  obtain e1 e2 where "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e1 ∧ Factor e1 ∧ In e1 (Driving CancerDevelopment) ∧ Through e1 e2 ∧ Where e2 (Factor LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction) ∧ Involves e2 (Driving CancerDevelopment) ∧ Involves e2 GenomicInstability" <ATP>
  hence "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e ∧ Driving e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
