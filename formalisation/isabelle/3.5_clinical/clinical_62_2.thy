(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 being a human gene implies that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ⟶ HumanProtein x"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 being a human gene implies that the protein associated with BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ Associated y x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 is a human protein). *)
  (* Since BRCA2 is a human gene, we can infer that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x" sledgehammer
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, the protein associated with BRCA2 is involved in HRR). *)
  (* Given that BRCA2 is a human gene, we can deduce that the protein associated with BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
