(* Explanation 1: The event e2, where the loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, directly leads to genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e2 x. Event e2 ∧ Factor x LossOfBRCA2 ∧ Leads e2 GenomicInstability ∧ Directly e2 ∧ IsFactor x LossOfBRCA2"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 gene function in event e2 results in the development of genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e2. Event e2 ∧ LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e2 ∧ ResultsIn e2 DevelopmentOfGenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 LossOfBRCA2"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
  shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Drives e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that LossOfBRCA2 is LossOfBRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 LossOfBRCA2" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 which are relevant to LossOfBRCA2 and GenomicInstability. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we have LossOfBRCA2 is a factor that leads to GenomicInstability. *)
  obtain e2 where e2: "Event e2 ∧ Factor LossOfBRCA2 LossOfBRCA2 ∧ Leads e2 GenomicInstability ∧ Directly e2 ∧ IsFactor LossOfBRCA2 LossOfBRCA2"
    <ATP>
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have LossOfBRCA2 gene function results in the development of GenomicInstability. *)
  obtain e where e: "Event e ∧ LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e ∧ ResultsIn e DevelopmentOfGenomicInstability"
    <ATP>
  (* Combining the information from e2 and e, we can conclude that LossOfBRCA2 drives CancerDevelopment via GenomicInstability. *)
  have "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Drives e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
    <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
