(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is involved in the process of HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ InvolvedIn x HRR"

(* Explanation 2: InvolvedIn(x, HRR) *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedIn x HRR"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x ∧ Human x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedIn x HRR ∧ Human x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in the process of HRR. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(BRCA2 is involved in the process of HRR, InvolvedIn x HRR) *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 x implies InvolvedIn x HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x HRR" <ATP>
  (* Also, from the premise, we know that the entity is human. *)
  from asm have "Human x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
