(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Inhibitors x ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Purpose e (TargetingTumourSpecificDefectsInDNARepair)"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Inhibitors x ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Manner e (RecoveryFromDNADamage)"

(* Explanation 3: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the role of PARP1/2 in the recovery from DNA damage is crucial *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e x. Inhibitors x ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Crucial (RoleOfPARP1_2) (RecoveryFromDNADamage)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors x"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e x. Inhibitors x ∧ TargetingTumourSpecificDefectsInDNARepair e ∧ Target e x ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e RoleOfPARP1_2 ∧ RecoverFromDNADamage RoleOfPARP1_2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x involves Inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1, 2, and 3 which are relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we can infer that the purpose of an agent involving PARP1/2 inhibitors is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we can infer that the manner in which an agent involving PARP1/2 inhibitors acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 3, we can infer that the role of PARP1/2 in the recovery from DNA damage is crucial. *)
  (* Combining these inferences, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃e. TargetingTumourSpecificDefectsInDNARepair e ∧ (∃x. Target x ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e RoleOfPARP1_2 ∧ RecoverFromDNADamage RoleOfPARP1_2)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
