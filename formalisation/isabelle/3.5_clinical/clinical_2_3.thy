(* Explanation 1: Synthetic lethality is when co-occurrence of multiple genetic events results in cell death *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. SyntheticLethality x ⟷ CoOccurrenceMultipleGeneticEventsResultsCellDeath x"

(* Explanation 2: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ ByPreventing e x ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks ∧ RelyingOn e DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair ∧ RelyingOn e ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining ∧ RepairDNA e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DueTo e SyntheticLethality ∧ Cause SyntheticLethality CellsRelyOnSingularMechanismRepairCumulativeDamageDNA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the patients and the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence about PARP inhibitors causing replication‐associated double strand breaks. *)
  (* We can infer that PARP inhibitors cause preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error prone non-homologous end joining. *)
  (* These mechanisms are related to repairing DNA. *)
  then have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DueTo e SyntheticLethality ∧ Cause SyntheticLethality CellsRelyOnSingularMechanismRepairCumulativeDamageDNA" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
