(* Explanation 1: If CFI-402257 is suitable for a patient, then the patient will not have to travel *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e1 e2. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suitable e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e2 y ⟶ (¬Travel e2 ∧ Have e2 ∧ Modal e2 y will ∧ ¬Suitable e2)"

(* Explanation 2: If CFI-402257 is not suitable for a patient, then the patient will have to travel *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬Suitable e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e2 y ⟶ (Travel e2 ∧ Have e2 ∧ Modal e2 y will ∧ Suitable e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suitable e"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Travel e ∧ Have e ∧ Modal e will ∧ ¬Suitable e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about CFI-402257, Patient, and Suitable event. *)
  from asm have "CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suitable e" <ATP>
  (* We have two explanatory sentences related to CFI-402257 and Patient. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations and derived implications to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* From Implies(A, Not(B)), we can infer Not(the patient will not have to travel) when CFI-402257 is suitable for a patient. *)
  (* From Implies(Not(A), C), we can infer the patient will have to travel when CFI-402257 is not suitable for a patient. *)
  (* Since the premise states CFI-402257 is suitable, we can conclude that the patient will have to travel. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "¬Travel e ∧ Have e ∧ Modal e will ∧ ¬Suitable e" <ATP>
  (* We can further simplify the conclusion to match the hypothesis format. *)
  then have "Patient y ∧ Travel e ∧ Have e ∧ Modal e will ∧ ¬Suitable e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
