(* Explanation 1: Having an activating mutation in CTNNB1 implies that TTK inhibitors may be effective in the patient by directly affecting the patient's response to the treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Mutation x ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ Implies e ∧ Inhibitors y ∧ TTK y ∧ Effective z ∧ Patient z ∧ Response z ∧ Treatment z ∧ DirectlyAffecting e"

(* Explanation 2: The potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient is suggested when there is a specific interaction between the TTK inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Effectiveness x ∧ TTKInhibitors y ∧ Patient z ∧ Suggested e ∧ Interaction e ∧ BiologicalPathways e ∧ InfluencedBy e ∧ Mutation x ∧ CTNNB1 x"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y e. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In x e ∧ In y e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about TTK Inhibitor x and Patient y. *)
  from asm have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" <ATP>
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences that connect TTK Inhibitors, Patients, and Effectiveness. *)
  (* Explanation 1: Having an activating mutation in CTNNB1 implies that TTK inhibitors may be effective in the patient by directly affecting the patient's response to the treatment. *)
  (* Explanation 2: The potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient is suggested when there is a specific interaction between the TTK inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer that TTK Inhibitors may be effective in the patient. *)
  then have "Effective e" for some e <ATP>
  (* From Explanation 2, we can infer that there is an interaction involving TTK Inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  then have "In x e ∧ In y e" for some x y e <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
