(* Explanation 1: Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are specifically identified by the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PatientsDiagnosedWithTNBC x ⟶ (IdentifiedBy x (Absence x HER2) ∧ IdentifiedBy x (Absence x ER) ∧ IdentifiedBy x (Absence x PR))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "¬∃z. (Expression z y ∧ (ER z ∨ PR z ∨ HER2 z))"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the patient having breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" and "BreastCancer y" and "HasCancer x y" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis involves the absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression in breast cancer. *)
  (* We know that Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are identified by the absence of ER, PR, and HER2 expression. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, (B and C and D)), Implies(Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, absence of PR expression) *)
  (* Since the patient has breast cancer, which is equivalent to Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, we can infer the absence of PR expression. *)
  then have "¬∃z. (Expression z y ∧ (ER z ∨ PR z ∨ HER2 z))" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
