(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRAF x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Play e ∧ Role e ∧ Important e ∧ Regulate e MAPKinERK)"

(* Explanation 2: the MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. MAPKinaseERK e ∧ Affect e CellDivision ∧ Affect e Differentiation ∧ Affect e Secretion"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion *)
 shows "∃e. BRAF x ∧ Role e ∧ In e CellDivision ∧ In e Differentiation ∧ In e Secretion ∧ Regulate e MAPKinERK"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRAF is a proto-oncogene, BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since we have BRAF x, we can infer that BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  (* This implies that the MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that BRAF x plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion through its regulation of MAPK/ERK. *)
  then have "∃e. BRAF x ∧ Role e ∧ In e CellDivision ∧ In e Differentiation ∧ In e Secretion ∧ Regulate e MAPKinERK" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
