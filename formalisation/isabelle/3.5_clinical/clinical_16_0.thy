(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x HomologousRecombinationRepair x"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ Wherein x x DamagedDNA UndamagedHomologousMolecules SisterChromatids PaternalCopies MaternalCopies"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA break repair via homologous recombination repair *)
  shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ InvolvedIn x DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess ∧ Via x HomologousRecombinationRepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x HomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition A from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* A: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical proposition B from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* B: homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 is involved in double strand break DNA repair process. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ⟶ InvolvedIn x x DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess" <ATP>
  (* We can also infer that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair via the logical proposition A. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ⟶ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can conclude that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA repair via homologous recombination repair. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
