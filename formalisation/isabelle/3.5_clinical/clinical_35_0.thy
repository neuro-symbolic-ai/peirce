(* Explanation 1: Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ BetaCatenin y ⟶ Decrease e"

(* Explanation 2: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. CTNNB1Mutation x ∧ Activating x ∧ Cell y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ BetaCatenin e ∧ Promote e ∧ Via e z"

(* Explanation 3: There are Notch inhibitors in development. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x. NotchInhibitor x ∧ InDevelopment x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ In e y ∧ With e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has CTNNB1 mutation and it is activating. *)
  from asm have "Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z" by simp
  (* We have the logical proposition A: Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin) *)
  (* We can use Explanation 1 to infer that Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "Decrease e" using explanation_2 explanation_3 by blast
  (* We also have the logical proposition B: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to infer that Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "Cell y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ BetaCatenin e ∧ Promote e ∧ Via e z" sledgehammer
  (* We know there are Notch inhibitors in development from Explanation 3. *)
  from explanation_3 obtain x where "NotchInhibitor x ∧ InDevelopment x" by auto
  (* We can combine the above information to show that a Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ In e y ∧ With e z" sledgehammer
