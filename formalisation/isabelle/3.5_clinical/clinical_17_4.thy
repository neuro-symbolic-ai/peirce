(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x x)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "HumanGene x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since BRCA2 x, we can infer HumanGene x and Encodes x x. *)
  then have "HumanGene x" and "Encodes x x" using explanation_1 apply blast
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein, BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor) *)
  (* Both B and C are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since we have Encodes x x, we can infer BRCA2Protein x, TumourSuppressor x. *)
  then have "BRCA2Protein x" and "TumourSuppressor x" by (simp add: assms explanation_1)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor, BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since we have TumourSuppressor x, we can infer InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we have shown that HumanGene x and InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
