(* Explanation 1: Inhibition of PARP leads to the occurrence of double strand breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ DoubleStrandBreaks y ⟶ Leads e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ DoubleStrandBreaks y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair z ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining z ∧ RepairDNA z ⟶ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Manner e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Inhibition of PARP and occurrence of double strand breaks. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ DoubleStrandBreaks y" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states: Inhibition of PARP leads to the occurrence of double strand breaks. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inhibition of PARP, occurrence of double strand breaks). *)
  (* Both A and B are from the explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the occurrence of double strand breaks. *)
  then have "Leads e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* To prove the hypothesis, we need to show the existence of PARP inhibitors, replication-associated double strand breaks, preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, error prone non-homologous end joining, repair DNA, cause event, agent, patient, and manner. *)
  (* We can introduce the necessary entities and events to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
