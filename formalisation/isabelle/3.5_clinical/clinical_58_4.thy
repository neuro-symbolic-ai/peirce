(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Humans z ⟶ (InvolvedInHRR x z ∧ InvolvedInHRR y z)"

(* Explanation 2: The binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Binding z ∧ Catalyzes e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ Undamaged x ∧ Homologous x"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Humans z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about BRCA2, RepairMolecules, Undamaged, and Homologous. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RepairMolecules y" and "Undamaged y" and "Homologous y" <ATP>
  
  (* We know from the explanation that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR in humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR in humans, The binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules) *)
  (* We can infer the binding, catalyzes, joining, agent, patient, via, and humans from the explanation. *)
  obtain a b c d where "Binding a" and "Catalyzes b" and "Joining d" and "Agent b c" and "Patient b x" and "Patient b y" and "Via b c" and "RAD51Homolog1 c" and "Humans c" 
    <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the information from the premise and the derived information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  have "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining d ∧ Agent b x ∧ Patient b y ∧ Via b c ∧ RAD51Homolog1 c ∧ Humans c"
