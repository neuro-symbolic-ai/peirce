(* Explanation 1: If CTNNB1 has the mutation W25_H36del, then it is an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. CTNNB1 x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ W25_H36del y ⟶ Activating y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ In x y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has the mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have the logical proposition A: CTNNB1 has the mutation W25_H36del, and B: CTNNB1 is an activating mutation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(CTNNB1 has the mutation W25_H36del, CTNNB1 is an activating mutation). *)
  (* Since the patient has the mutation, we can infer that it is an activating mutation. *)
  then have "∃y. Mutation y ∧ In x y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
