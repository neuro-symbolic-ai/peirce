(* Explanation 1: If the recipient of an event is also the patient, then the event is for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Recipient x ∧ Patient y ⟶ For x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Recipient x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
 shows "∃x y. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Unavailable x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the recipient and the patient. *)
  from asm have "Recipient x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states if the recipient of an event is also the patient, then the event is for that patient. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, event is for that patient) *)
  (* Since we have Recipient x and Patient y, we can infer For x y. *)
  then have "For x y" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* The hypothesis involves the combination of vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor being unavailable for the patient. *)
  (* We can express this as Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Unavailable x y. *)
