(* Explanation 1: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 are directly linked to β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 x ∧ BetaCatenin y ⟶ DirectlyLinked x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ Patient y"
 (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃e x y z. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ With e y ∧ With e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there are activating mutations of CTNNB1 and a patient. *)
  from asm have "ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that activating mutations of CTNNB1 are directly linked to β-catenin. *)
  (* We can infer that if there are activating mutations of CTNNB1, then there is a direct link to β-catenin. *)
  (* This implies that inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "∃e x y z. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ With e y ∧ With e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
