(* Explanation 1: BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion, as well as plays a specific role in these processes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y z. Regulation e MAPK_ERK ∧ Influences e ∧ In e (CellDivision y) ∧ In e (Differentiation y) ∧ In e (Secretion y) ∧ PlaysRole e ∧ SpecificRole e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion through its regulation of MAPK/ERK. *)
 shows "∃e x y z. BRAF x ∧ Role e ∧ In e (CellDivision y) ∧ In e (Differentiation y) ∧ In e (Secretion y) ∧ Regulation e MAPK_ERK ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by auto
  (* We have the explanatory sentence stating that BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion, as well as plays a specific role in these processes. *)
  (* This implies that BRAF's regulation of MAPK/ERK plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF x plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion through its regulation of MAPK/ERK. *)
  then have "∃e x y z. BRAF x ∧ PlaysRole e ∧ In e (CellDivision y) ∧ In e (Differentiation y) ∧ In e (Secretion y) ∧ Regulation e MAPK_ERK ∧ Agent e x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
