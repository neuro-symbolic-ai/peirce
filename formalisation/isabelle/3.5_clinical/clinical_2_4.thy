(* Explanation 1: Synthetic lethality is when co-occurrence of multiple genetic events results in cell death *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. SyntheticLethality x ⟷ CoOccurrence y ∧ CellDeath y"

(* Explanation 2: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Cause e ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ Preventing y SingleStrandBreakRepair ∧ RelyingOn x RepairMechanism ∧ Repair DNA"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1Inhibition y ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Cause e ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Reason e z ∧ RelyOn x RepairMechanism ∧ Repair DNA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the patients and the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x" by simp
