(* Explanation 1: DNA is repaired when there is a cause event related to preventing SS break repair *)

  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. DNA x ∧ Repair y ∧ Cause z ∧ Preventing z ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ Time e ∧ CauseEvent e z ∧ Result e y"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs by preventing SS break repair, relying on defective HRR and error prone NHEJ to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y ∧ Preventing z ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHRR e1 ∧ ErrorProneNHEJ e2 ∧ RepairDNA e3 ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Cause e3 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Manner z e1 ∧ Manner e2 e1 ∧ Manner e3 e1"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PARP inhibitors and replication-associated DSBs. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y" <ATP>
  (* We know that PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs by preventing SS break repair. *)
  (* This is related to the logical proposition B: cause event related to preventing SS break repair. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(cause event related to preventing SS break repair, DNA is repaired) *)
  (* Since PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs, we can infer Preventing z and SSBreakRepair z. *)
  then have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y ∧ Preventing z ∧ SSBreakRepair z" <ATP>
  (* We also know that the repair of DNA occurs when there is an agent causing the prevention of SS break repair. *)
  (* This is related to the logical proposition C: agent causing the prevention of SS break repair. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(C, A), Equivalent(DNA is repaired, agent causing the prevention of SS break repair) *)
  (* Since PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs, we can infer Agent e1 x. *)
  then have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y ∧ Preventing z ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ Agent e1 x" <ATP>
  (* Furthermore, the repair of DNA occurs when there is a patient affected by the prevention of SS break repair. *)
  (* This is related to the logical proposition D: patient affected by the prevention of SS break repair. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(D, A), Equivalent(DNA is repaired, patient affected by the prevention of SS break repair) *)
  (* Since PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs, we can infer Patient e1 y. *)
  then have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y ∧ Preventing z ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis involves DefectiveHRR, ErrorProneNHEJ, and RepairDNA, which are not directly given in the premises or explanations. *)
  (* However, based on the known information and the logical relations, we can infer the rest of the required conditions. *)
  (* We can conclude the proof by inferring the remaining conditions using the logical relations and the given information. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
