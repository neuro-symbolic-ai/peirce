(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
  shows "HumanGene x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since BRCA2 x, we can infer HumanGene x and Encodes x BRCA2Protein. *)
  then have "HumanGene x" and "Encodes x BRCA2Protein" <ATP>
  (* We have another logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein, BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor) *)
  (* Both B and C are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since BRCA2Protein x, we can infer TumourSuppressor x and InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x. *)
  then have "TumourSuppressor x" and "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have proven that HumanGene x and InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
