(* Explanation 1: Remove the redundant statement "then have ActivatingMutation x" from the axioms as it does not add any new information *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Statement x ∧ Redundant x ∧ Axiom x ⟶ ¬Add x ∧ NewInformation x"

(* Explanation 2: Add a new explanatory sentence specifying that an activating mutation in breast cancer implies it is an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. You x ∧ ExplanatorySentence x ∧ New x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x BreastCancer ⟶ ActivatingMutation x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3Ca x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" by auto
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states an activating mutation in breast cancer implies it is an activating mutation. *)
  (* We can apply this explanatory sentence to infer that PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "ActivatingMutation x" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis includes that PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  (* Since we have already established that PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation, we can conclude the rest of the hypothesis. *)
  then show "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" <ATP>
