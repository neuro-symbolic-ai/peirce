(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR"

(* Explanation 2: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HRR x ⟶ DSB_DNA_repair_process x ∧ ReplacedBy x undamaged_homologous_molecules ∧ From x sister_chromatids ∧ From x paternal_copies ∧ From x maternal_copies"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_repair_via_HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* BRCA2 is related to logical proposition A. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* Both A and C are from explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer HumanProtein x and InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_repair_via_HRR. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_repair_via_HRR" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
