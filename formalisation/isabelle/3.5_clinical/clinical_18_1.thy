(* Explanation 1: An event occurs where damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. Event e ∧ DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess e"
  (* Hypothesis: homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that homologous recombination repair and double-strand break DNA repair process are occurring in event e. *)
  from asm have "HomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess e" by simp
  (* The hypothesis states that damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* We have the logical proposition A: event occurs, which implies that damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  (* Since the event e involves homologous recombination repair and double-strand break DNA repair process, it follows that damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  then have "DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
