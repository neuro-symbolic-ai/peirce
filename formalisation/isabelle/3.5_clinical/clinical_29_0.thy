(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Inhibit x beta_catenin ∧ Effective y ∧ Treating z Patient ∧ Activating z CTTNB1 ∧ MayBe y x z"

(* Explanation 2: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway have shown activity in reducing β-catenin levels *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Drug x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ ShowActivity y ∧ Reduce z beta_catenin ∧ In y z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient z ∧ Activating z CTTNB1"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃x y. Drug x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ Effective y ∧ MayBe y x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is z and z is activating CTTNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient z ∧ Activating z CTTNB1" <ATP>
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences: A and B. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(B, A), which means Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway have shown activity in reducing β-catenin levels implies Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
  (* Both B and A are from the explanatory sentences. *)
  (* We can infer that Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "∃x y. Drug x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ Effective y ∧ MayBe y x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
