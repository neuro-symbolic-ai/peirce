(* Explanation 1: For any entity x, if x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity x, if x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 x" apply auto[1]
  (* We have explanatory sentence 1: For any entity x, if x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We have explanatory sentence 2: For any entity x, if x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  (* Both BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x are involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* Therefore, they are involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x" by (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
