(* Explanation 1: In the absence of functional homologous recombination repair genes, the repair process defaults to a specific type of repair mechanism *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. RepairProcess x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepairGenes y ∧ SpecificTypeRepairMechanism z ⟶ (Defaults e ∧ Patient e x ∧ InAbsenceOf x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "RepairProcess x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepairGenes y ∧ SpecificTypeRepairMechanism z"
 (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes *)
 shows "∃x y z e. LossBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ∧ NonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses z ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DefaultTo e z"
proof -
  (* Given the premise, we have information about the repair process, homologous recombination repair genes, and specific type repair mechanism. *)
  from asm have "RepairProcess x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepairGenes y ∧ SpecificTypeRepairMechanism z" by blast
  (* From the explanatory sentence, we know that in the absence of functional homologous recombination repair genes, the repair process defaults to a specific type of repair mechanism. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), B), Implies(Not(presence of functional homologous recombination repair genes), repair process defaults to a specific type of repair mechanism) *)
  (* We can infer that if there is no presence of functional homologous recombination repair genes, the repair process defaults to a specific type of repair mechanism. *)
  (* Since we have the presence of homologous recombination repair genes, we cannot infer the default repair process. *)
  then have "¬Defaults e" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis states that the loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
  (* We need to show that there exists a loss of BRCA2, a cell, non-homologous end joining repair processes, a cause event, an agent, a patient, and a default event. *)
  (* However, based on the information and the derived implications, we cannot directly infer the required elements for the hypothesis. *)
  (* Therefore, the proof cannot be completed with the given information and logical relations. *)
  (* Additional information or logical relations are needed to establish a direct connection between the loss of BRCA2 and the default repair process. *)
