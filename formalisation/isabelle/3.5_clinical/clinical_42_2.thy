(* Explanation 1: The potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. CREBBP x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Role z ∧ In x z ∧ LeadsDirectly e ∧ Cause e z ∧ RelevantFor z y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y"
 (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ RelevantFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is relevant. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" by simp
  (* The relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient is directly related to the potential role of CREBBP in cancer. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that connects CREBBP, Cancer, Role, LeadsDirectly, Cause, and RelevantFor. *)
  (* We can infer the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient based on the potential role of CREBBP in cancer. *)
  then have "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ RelevantFor x y" sledgehammer
