(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting PARP results in accumulation of SS breaks. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y. InhibitingPARP x ∧ AccumulationOfSSBreaks y ⟶ ResultsIn e x y"

(* Explanation 2: SS breaks collapse replication forks and trigger HRR. *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitingPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
 shows "∃e. ResultsIn e x y ∧ DSB y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about inhibiting PARP and collapsed replication forks. *)
  from asm have "InhibitingPARP x" and "CollapsedReplicationForks y" apply auto[1]
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Inhibiting PARP, SS breaks collapse replication forks) *)
  (* We can infer SS breaks collapse replication forks from inhibiting PARP. *)
  from ‹InhibitingPARP x› have "SSBreaks z" for z by (simp add: assms)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(accumulation of SS breaks, trigger HRR) *)
  (* We can infer trigger HRR from accumulation of SS breaks. *)
  from ‹SSBreaks z› have "trigger HRR w" for z w sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(Inhibiting PARP, trigger HRR) *)
  (* We can infer trigger HRR from inhibiting PARP. *)
  from ‹InhibitingPARP x› have "trigger HRR w" for w <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inhibiting PARP, accumulation of SS breaks) *)
  (* We can infer accumulation of SS breaks from inhibiting PARP. *)
  from ‹InhibitingPARP x› have "accumulation of SS breaks v" for v <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(accumulation of SS breaks, SS breaks collapse replication forks) *)
  (* We can infer SS breaks collapse replication forks from accumulation of SS breaks. *)
  from ‹accumulation of SS breaks v› have "SS breaks collapse replication forks u" for v u <ATP>
  (* We have SS breaks collapse replication forks and trigger HRR, which are related to the hypothesis. *)
  then have "ResultsIn e x y ∧ DSB y" for e x y <ATP>
  then show ?thesis by auto
