(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain should overcome trastuzumab resistance that has been induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e. Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Should e ∧ Overcome e ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ InducedBy y HER2ActivatingMutation ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. HER2V777L x ∧ Cause e ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ BindsTo y ExtracellularKinaseDomain ∧ Mutation z ∧ In z IntracellularKinaseDomain ∧ May e ∧ Agent e x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HERV777L x"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Targeting e ∧ HERV777L x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ Irreversible y ∧ TyrosineKinase y ∧ May e ∧ Overcome e ∧ Resistance z ∧ Treatment z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about HER2 V777L. *)
  from asm have "HER2V777L x" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(HER2 V777L, cause resistance to trastuzumab) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer that HER2 V777L causes resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  then have "Cause e ∧ Resistance z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Agent e x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence 1 that connects an irreversible inhibitor targeted to the HER2 kinase domain with overcoming trastuzumab resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
  (* We need to find a connection between the HER2 V777L mutation and the treatment resistance. *)
  (* Since the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain and trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, we can infer that the mutation is not directly related to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot directly link HER2 V777L to the treatment resistance based on the given information. *)
  (* Hence, we cannot prove the hypothesis with the provided information. *)
  (* Thus, the proof is not possible with the current knowledge. *)
