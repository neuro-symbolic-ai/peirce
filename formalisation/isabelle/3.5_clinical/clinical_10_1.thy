(* Explanation 1: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of single strand DNA damage implies the involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y. PARP1 x ∧ Detects e ∧ Binds e ∧ SitesOf e single ∧ SitesOf e strand ∧ Implies e (InvolvementIn x (RecognitionOf e DNA) ∧ RepairOf e DNA)"

(* Explanation 2: The detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of single strand DNA damage lead to its role in DNA damage recognition and repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. DetectionAndBindingOfPARP1 e ∧ SitesOf e single ∧ SitesOf e strand ⟶ RoleIn e x ∧ RecognitionOf e DNA ∧ RepairOf e DNA"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in single strand DNA damage repair *)
 shows "∃e. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvementIn e x ∧ RecognitionOf e DNA ∧ RepairOf e DNA ∧ single e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP1 x. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" <ATP>
  (* PARP1 detects and binds to sites of single strand DNA damage is related to the involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PARP1 detects and binds to sites of single strand DNA damage, involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer the involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
  then have "∃e. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvementIn e x ∧ RecognitionOf e DNA ∧ RepairOf e DNA ∧ single e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
