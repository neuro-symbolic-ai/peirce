(* Explanation 1: If the patient will have to travel, then the treatment may not be suitable *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Travel e1 ∧ HaveTo e1 ⟶ MayNotBeSuitable e2"

(* Explanation 2: If the treatment is suitable, then the patient will not have to travel *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. Treatment x ∧ Suitable x ⟶ (Patient y ∧ Travel e1 ∧ HaveTo e1 ⟶ ¬HaveTo e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Travel e ∧ HaveTo e ∧ MayNotBeSuitable e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 which are relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(the patient will have to travel, the treatment may not be suitable) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(the treatment is suitable, the patient will not have to travel) *)
  (* We can use these relations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* From Implies(A, B), we can infer MayNotBeSuitable e. *)
  (* From Implies(C, D), we can infer ¬HaveTo e. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Travel e ∧ HaveTo e ∧ MayNotBeSuitable e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
