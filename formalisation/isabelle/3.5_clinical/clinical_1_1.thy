(* Explanation 1: Olaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licenced for use in prostate cancer patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Olaparib x ⟶ (PARP1Inhibitor x ∧ LicencedForUseIn x (ProstateCancerPatients x))"

(* Explanation 2: Rucaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licenced for use in prostate cancer patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Rucaparib x ⟶ (PARP1Inhibitor x ∧ LicencedForUseIn x (ProstateCancerPatients x))"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1Inhibition y ∧ SyntheticLethality y ∧ Cause y ∧ CellsRelianceOn x (RepairMechanism y) ∧ CumulativeDamageToDNA x ⟶ BenefitFrom x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TreatmentOption y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 stating that Olaparib and Rucaparib are PARP1 inhibitors licenced for use in prostate cancer patients. *)
  (* There are logical relations Equivalent(A, B) and Equivalent(B, A). *)
  (* We can infer that Olaparib and Rucaparib are interchangeable in this context. *)
  (* Therefore, the patient x has two potential treatment options. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TreatmentOption y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
