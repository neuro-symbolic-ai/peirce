(* Explanation 1: Having an activating mutation in CTNNB1 implies that TTK inhibitors may be effective in the patient by directly affecting the patient's response to the treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Mutation x ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ Implies e ∧ In x e ∧ In y e ∧ In z e ∧ TTKInhibitor y ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective e ∧ DirectlyAffecting e z"

(* Explanation 2: The potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient is suggested when there is a specific interaction between the TTK inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suggested e ∧ In x e ∧ In y e ∧ In z e ∧ Interaction z ∧ BiologicalPathways z ∧ InfluencedBy z x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In x e ∧ In y e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the TTK Inhibitor and the patient. *)
  from asm have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, B), which states that if there is a specific interaction between the TTK inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB, then TTK inhibitors may be effective in the patient. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides the necessary condition for the potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  (* We can infer the effectiveness of the TTK inhibitor in the patient based on the specific interaction and biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  obtain z e where "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suggested e ∧ In x e ∧ In y e ∧ In z e ∧ Interaction z ∧ BiologicalPathways z ∧ InfluencedBy z x"
    sledgehammer
  
  (* Since the TTK Inhibitor is suggested to be effective in the patient based on the specific interaction and biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB, we can conclude the effectiveness. *)
  then have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In x e ∧ In y e" <ATP>
