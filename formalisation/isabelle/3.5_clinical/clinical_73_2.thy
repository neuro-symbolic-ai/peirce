(* Explanation 1: Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ A3140G y ∧ MetastaticBreastCancer y"

(* Explanation 2: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. PIK3Ca x ⟶ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ InBreastCancer x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ Frequent y ∧ InBreastCancer y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ In(x, y) ∧ Frequent y ∧ InBreastCancer y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient, activating mutation, PIK3CA, frequent mutation, and in breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ Frequent y ∧ InBreastCancer y" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer, PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer) *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 2, which includes PIK3CA, known, frequent, activating mutation, and in breast cancer. *)
  (* We already have PIK3CA y and Frequent y, so we can infer Known y and InBreastCancer y. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ In(x, y) ∧ Frequent y ∧ InBreastCancer y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
