(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies that it can cause chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ HumanProtein e ⟶ (CanCause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HumanProtein x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that HumanProtein x. *)
  from asm have "HumanProtein x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies it can cause chromosome breakage. *)
  (* We can infer that LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ CanCause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage from the explanatory sentence. *)
  (* Since we know HumanProtein x, we can conclude that there exists an event e such that LossOfBRCA2 e, CanCause e, and Patient e ChromosomeBreakage. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ CanCause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
