(* Explanation 1: There exists an event where the patient with TNBC had a stable disease after treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z ∧ After e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z ∧ After e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" <ATP>
  (* Given the explanation sentence, there exists an event where the patient with TNBC had a stable disease after treatment. *)
  (* We can infer that there exists an event where the patient had a disease and it was stable after treatment. *)
  then obtain e y z where "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z ∧ After e z" <ATP>
  (* We have obtained the required information about the patient, disease, stability, treatment, and the event. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
