(* Explanation 1: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"

(* Explanation 2: There are no licensed Notch inhibitors available *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. NotchInhibitor x ⟶ ¬Licensed x ∧ Available x"

(* Explanation 3: There are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for hepatoblastoma patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. NotchInhibitor x ∧ ClinicalTrials y ∧ HepatoblastomaPatient z ⟶ ¬AvailableFor x z"

(* Explanation 4: There are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for pediatric patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. NotchInhibitor x ∧ ClinicalTrials y ∧ PediatricPatient z ⟶ ¬AvailableFor x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Treatment x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: This treatment is not available for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. Treatment x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotAvailableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a treatment for a patient. *)
  from asm have "Treatment x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* We have the information that a Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient, There are no licenced Notch inhibitors available) *)
  (* We can infer that there are no licensed Notch inhibitors available. *)
  then have "¬Licensed x ∧ Available x" for x sledgehammer
  (* There are no licensed Notch inhibitors available, which implies there are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for hepatoblastoma patients. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(There are no licenced Notch inhibitors available, There are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for hepatoblastoma patients) *)
  (* Therefore, we can deduce that there are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for hepatoblastoma patients. *)
  then have "¬AvailableFor x y" if "NotchInhibitor x ∧ ClinicalTrials y ∧ HepatoblastomaPatient y" for x y <ATP>
  (* Since there are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for hepatoblastoma patients, we can conclude that the treatment is not available for this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. Treatment x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotAvailableFor x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
