(* Explanation 1: The event e2, where the loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, directly leads to genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e2. Event e2 ∧ Factor e2 LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction ∧ Leads e2 GenomicInstability ∧ Directly e2"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 gene function in event e2 results in the development of genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e2. Event e2 ∧ LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e2 ∧ ResultsIn e2 DevelopmentOfGenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
  shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e ∧ Drives e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the loss of BRCA2 gene function. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 which are relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* Explanatory sentence 1 states that the event e2, where the loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, directly leads to genomic instability. *)
  (* Explanatory sentence 2 states that the loss of BRCA2 gene function in event e2 results in the development of genomic instability. *)
  (* Both sentences are related to the loss of BRCA2 gene function and genomic instability. *)
  (* From the logical proposition Implies(B, C), we can infer that the loss of BRCA2 gene function leads to genomic instability. *)
  then have "GenomicInstability e" <ATP>
  (* We can now conclude that the loss of BRCA2 gene function drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
