(* Explanation 1: If a patient has hepatoblastoma and there is a specific entity related to the patient with CTNNB1 W25_H36del, then that entity has an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ RelatedTo x z ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ W25_H36del z ⟶ ActivatingMutation e ∧ In z e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient implies the presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ RelatedTo x z ⟶ (∃e'. ActivatingMutation e' ∧ In z e')"

(* Explanation 3: The activating mutation in CTNNB1 is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. ActivatingMutation e ∧ In x e ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ RelatedTo x y ∧ Hepatoblastoma y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has hepatoblastoma and is related to an entity with CTNNB1 W25_H36del. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 1 to infer that the related entity has an activating mutation. *)
  from asm and explanation_1 have "∃z e. RelatedTo x z ∧ ActivatingMutation e ∧ In z e" <ATP>
  then obtain z e where "RelatedTo x z ∧ ActivatingMutation e ∧ In z e" by auto
  (* Using the obtained information, we can apply Explanation 3 to link the activating mutation in CTNNB1 to the patient's condition. *)
  from `RelatedTo x z ∧ ActivatingMutation e ∧ In z e` and explanation_3 have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation e ∧ In z e ∧ CTNNB1 z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
