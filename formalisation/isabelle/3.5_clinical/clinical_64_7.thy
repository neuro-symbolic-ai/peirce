(* Explanation 1: A patient who is less sensitive to chemotherapy is more likely to have previously received endocrine therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ ChemotherapySensitivity y ∧ Less y ∧ SensitiveToChemotherapy x y ∧ Likely z ∧ PreviouslyReceivedEndocrineTherapy x z"

(* Explanation 2: Patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patients x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive x ∧ Patient x y ∧ Likely z ∧ Exhibit x ∧ ReducedSensitivityToChemotherapy x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ PreviouslyReceivedEndocrineTherapy e z ∧ Target e z ∧ PIK3CAMutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ PreviouslyReceivedEndocrineTherapy e z ∧ Target e z ∧ PIK3CAMutation z ∧ BenefitFrom x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the patient, endocrine therapy, receiving, agent, target, and PIK3CA mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ PreviouslyReceivedEndocrineTherapy e z ∧ Target e z ∧ PIK3CAMutation z" <ATP>
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences that can be used to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Explanation 1: A patient who is less sensitive to chemotherapy is more likely to have previously received endocrine therapy. *)
  (* Explanation 2: Patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations to connect the premises and the hypothesis. *)
  (* Implies(A, B), Implies(patient is less sensitive to chemotherapy, patient has previously received endocrine therapy) *)
  (* Implies(C, D), Implies(patient has received endocrine therapy, patient exhibits reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy) *)
  (* From the premise, we have Patient x, EndocrineTherapy y, and PreviouslyReceivedEndocrineTherapy e z. *)
  (* Using Implies(A, B), we can infer that the patient has previously received endocrine therapy. *)
  then have "BenefitFrom x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
