(* Explanation 1: If a patient receives treatment with Vemurafenib, then there is no rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ Vemurafenib e ∧ ReceivesTreatment e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ ¬(∃e1. RapidRecovery e1 ∧ MAPK_PathwaySignaling e1)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient does not receive treatment with Vemurafenib, then there is no rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ ¬(∃e1. Vemurafenib e1 ∧ ReceivesTreatment e1 ∧ Agent e1 x) ⟶ ¬(∃e2. RapidRecovery e2 ∧ MAPK_PathwaySignaling e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
 shows "∃e1 e2. Vemurafenib e1 ∧ MEK_Inhibitor e2 ∧ Combination e1 e2 ∧ BetterResults e1 ∧ Monotherapy e1"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* We have two relevant explanation sentences about the effects of Vemurafenib on the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling. *)
  (* We can use these to infer the absence of rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling when the patient receives or does not receive Vemurafenib treatment. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(patient receives treatment with Vemurafenib, Not(rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling)) *)
  (* Both A and B are related to the effects of Vemurafenib on the patient. *)
  (* Since the hypothesis involves Vemurafenib, we can infer that there is no rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling. *)
  then have "¬(∃e1. RapidRecovery e1 ∧ MAPK_PathwaySignaling e1)" by (meson explanation_1 explanation_2)
  (* To prove the hypothesis, we need to show the existence of Vemurafenib, a MEK inhibitor, a combination event, better results, and monotherapy. *)
  (* We can introduce these elements based on the requirements of the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
