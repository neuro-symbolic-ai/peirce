(* Explanation 1: A YAP inhibitor being effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity implies a relationship between the effectiveness of the YAP inhibitor and the inhibition of β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ Relationship e"

(* Explanation 2: The effectiveness of a YAP inhibitor in inhibiting β-catenin activity leads to the inhibition of β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ Inhibition e"

(* Explanation 3: If a YAP inhibitor is effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, then it can be considered as inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ Inhibition e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
 shows "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about YAP inhibitor x and β-catenin activity y. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by auto
  (* There are explanatory sentences 1, 2, and 3 that relate to the effectiveness of the YAP inhibitor and the inhibition of β-catenin activity. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations and derived implications to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(YAP inhibitor being effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, relationship between the effectiveness of the YAP inhibitor and the inhibition of β-catenin activity) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have YAPInhibitor x and βCateninActivity y, so we can infer EffectiveInhibiting e, Agent e x, and Patient e y. *)
  then have "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
