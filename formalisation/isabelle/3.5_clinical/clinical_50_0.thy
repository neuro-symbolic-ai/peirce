(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting PARP results in accumulation of SS breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y. InhibitingPARP x ∧ AccumulationOfSSBreaks y ∧ Results e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PARP1 x ∧ RecognitionAndRepairOfDNADamage y ∧ In (SSDNADamageRepair y) ⟶ InvolvedIn e x y"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "InhibitingPARP x ∧ AccumulationOfSSBreaks y"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting PARP results in accumulation of SS breaks *)
  shows "∃e x y. InhibitingPARP x ∧ AccumulationOfSSBreaks y ∧ Results e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about inhibiting PARP and accumulation of SS breaks. *)
  from asm have "InhibitingPARP x ∧ AccumulationOfSSBreaks y" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that inhibiting PARP results in the accumulation of SS breaks. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the results, agent, and patient involved. *)
  then obtain e where "Results e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
    <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that inhibiting PARP results in the accumulation of SS breaks. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
