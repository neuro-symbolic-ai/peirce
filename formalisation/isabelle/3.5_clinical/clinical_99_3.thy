(* Explanation 1: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BRAF x ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e ∧ PlaysRole e x z ∧ PlaysRole e x e ∧ PlaysRole e x e ∧ ThroughRegulation x y"

(* Explanation 2: A BRAF mutation is a spontaneous change in the BRAF gene that causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. BRAFMutation x ∧ SpontaneousChange y ∧ BRAFGene z ∧ Protein e ∧ TurnOn e ∧ KeepOn e ∧ Causes e x z"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. MutationInBRAF x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion e ∧ Affects e x y ∧ Affects e x z ∧ Affects e x e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion through the regulation of MAPK/ERK. *)
  (* There is an implication Implies(A, B), Implies(regulation of MAPK/ERK by BRAF, BRAF plays a role in cell division) *)
  (* There is an implication Implies(A, C), Implies(regulation of MAPK/ERK by BRAF, BRAF plays a role in differentiation) *)
  (* There is an implication Implies(A, D), Implies(regulation of MAPK/ERK by BRAF, BRAF plays a role in secretion) *)
  (* These implications allow us to infer that BRAF affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. MutationInBRAF x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion e ∧ Affects e x y ∧ Affects e x z ∧ Affects e x e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
