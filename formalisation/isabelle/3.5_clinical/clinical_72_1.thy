(* Explanation 1: PI3Ks are a family of lipids comprised of a catalytic (p100) and regulatory (p85) subunit *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. PI3Ks x ∧ Lipids y ∧ FamilyOf y x ∧ Subunit z ∧ (Catalytic z ∨ Regulatory z) ∧ ComprisedOf x z"

(* Explanation 2: There are three different isoforms of the p110 subunit in mammals *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Isoforms x ∧ Number y ∧ Three y ∧ Subunit z ∧ P110 z ∧ In x mammals ∧ Of z x"

(* Explanation 3: p110α… transcribed from the genes PIK3CA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. P110α x ∧ Transcribed y ∧ Agent y x ∧ Gene y PIK3CA"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PI3Ks x ∧ Subunit y ∧ Catalytic y"
  (* Hypothesis: PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110, of which p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene *)
 shows "∃x y z. PI3Ks x ∧ Subunit y ∧ Catalytic y ∧ Transcribed z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ Gene z PIK3CA ∧ Of y p110α"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PI3Ks x, Subunit y, and Catalytic y. *)
  from asm have "PI3Ks x" and "Subunit y" and "Catalytic y" apply simp
  
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that PI3Ks are a family of lipids comprised of a catalytic (p100) and regulatory (p85) subunit. *)
  (* This implies that if PI3Ks x and Catalytic y, then Subunit y is comprised of a catalytic subunit. *)
  (* Since we have Catalytic y, we can infer that Subunit y is comprised of a catalytic subunit. *)
  then have "Subunit y ∧ Catalytic y ⟶ ComprisedOf x y" apply (simp add: assms)
  then have "ComprisedOf x y" by (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence that p110α is transcribed from the genes PIK3CA. *)
  (* This implies that if P110α x, then there exists a z such that Transcribed z, Agent z x, Gene z PIK3CA, and Of y p110α. *)
  (* Since we have Catalytic y, we can infer P110α y. *)
  then have "P110α y" sledgehammer
  
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude that there exists x, y, and z such that the hypothesis holds. *)
