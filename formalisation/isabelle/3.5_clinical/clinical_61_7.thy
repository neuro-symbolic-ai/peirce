  DSB_DNA_break_repair_via_HRR :: "event"

(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_break_repair_via_HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* We have the logical proposition A: BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since BRCA2 is a human protein, we can infer that BRCA2 is involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_break_repair_via_HRR" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
