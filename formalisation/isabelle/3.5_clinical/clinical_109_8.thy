(* Explanation 1: Adding an explanatory sentence that states when a patient has the mutation V777L in HER2, it directly leads to the amplification of HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. ExplanatorySentence x ∧ Patient y ∧ Mutation y V777L HER2 ⟶ (Leads e ∧ Directly e ∧ Amplification e ∧ Of e HER)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y ∧ BreastCancer y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that directly links the mutation V777L in HER2 to the amplification of HER. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition A and B. *)
  (* We can infer that if a patient has the mutation V777L in HER2, it leads to the amplification of HER. *)
  (* Since the patient x is not directly related to the hypothesis, we can focus on the mutation and amplification. *)
  then have "Mutation x V777L HER2 ∧ Amplification x HER" sledgehammer
  (* We can combine the mutation and amplification to form the desired hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
