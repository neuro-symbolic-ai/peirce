(* Explanation 1: The presence of a specific interaction between TTK inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB1 is a crucial factor for the potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ BiologicalPathways z ∧ ActivatingMutation e ∧ InfluencedBy e z ∧ CrucialFactorFor e x y ∧ PotentialEffectivenessOf x y"

(* Explanation 2: The direct influence of the activating mutation in CTNNB1 on the patient's response to treatment is a key aspect that contributes to the effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient *)

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), which states that the specific interaction between TTK inhibitors and the patient's biological pathways influenced by the activating mutation in CTNNB1 is a crucial factor for the potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  (* This relation is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since the patient is x, we can infer the potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  then have "∃y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ PotentialEffectivenessOf x y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), which states that the direct influence of the activating mutation in CTNNB1 on the patient's response to treatment is a key aspect that contributes to the effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  (* This relation is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since the patient is x, we can infer the effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  then have "∃y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
