(* Explanation 1: For any event "e" such that the statement holds and "May e" is true, if "May e" implies an event according to a given explanation, and the event is related to inhibiting β-catenin activity, then the event is "EffectiveInhibiting e". *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. May e ∧ Holds e ∧ Implies e ∧ Explanation e ∧ RelatedTo e β-catenin_activity ⟶ EffectiveInhibiting e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ May e ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Inhibiting e β-catenin_activity"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a YAP inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x" by simp
  (* We have the logical proposition D: event is related to inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(event is related to inhibiting β-catenin activity, event is "EffectiveInhibiting e") *)
  (* Since we have a YAP inhibitor, we can infer that it may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  then have "∃x e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ May e ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Inhibiting e β-catenin_activity" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
