(* Explanation 1: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cell z ∧ βCatenin e ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Means e z"

(* Explanation 2: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCatenin y ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibit e x ∧ In e y ∧ Activity e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
  shows "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ Effective e ∧ In e x ∧ Inhibit e y ∧ Activity e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
  (* We can derive the relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Activating mutations of CTNNB1, via β-catenin). *)
  (* Since we have ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y, we can infer via β-catenin. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y› have "βCatenin e" <ATP>
  (* There is another explanatory sentence stating that a YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  (* We can derive the relation Implies(D, F), Implies(A YAP inhibitor, inhibiting β-catenin activity). *)
  (* Since we have βCatenin e, we can infer A YAP inhibitor. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹βCatenin e› have "YAPInhibitor x" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information obtained, we can construct the required conclusion. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ Effective e ∧ In e x ∧ Inhibit e y ∧ Activity e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
