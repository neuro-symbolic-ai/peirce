(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IntracellularKinaseDomain y ∧ TrastuzumabResistance z ∧ Contribute e ∧ ¬Directly e ∧ Patient e z ∧ Bind e ∧ Agent e z ∧ To e ExtracellularKinaseDomain z"

(* Explanation 2: The resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ResistanceInducedByHER2ActivatingMutation x ∧ ¬Related e ∧ Directly e ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation z ∧ RelatedTo e z"

(* Explanation 3: There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Identify e ∧ SpecificMechanism x ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Lead e ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentResistance z ∧ To e z Trastuzumab"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting e ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y ∧ Overcome e ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentResistance z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the HER2 V777L mutation and the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "HER2_V777L_Mutation x" and "IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y" apply blast
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, E), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, specific mechanism identified) *)
  (* We can infer that a specific mechanism is identified due to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
  then have "SpecificMechanism x" using assms by auto
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(C)), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain and not trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, not trastuzumab resistance) *)
  (* Since the HER2 V777L mutation is not directly contributing to trastuzumab resistance, we can infer not trastuzumab resistance. *)
  then have "¬TreatmentResistance z" sledgehammer
  
  (* We have the information about the HER2 V777L mutation, irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the absence of treatment resistance. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis that targeting the HER2 V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
