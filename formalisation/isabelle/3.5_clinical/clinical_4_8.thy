(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly leading to chromosome breakage implies that there is a causal relationship between the loss of BRCA2 and chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ DirectlyLeading e1 ∧ Patient e1 ChromosomeBreakage ∧ Implies e2 ∧ CausalRelationship e2 ∧ Agent e2 LossOfBRCA2 ∧ Patient e2 ChromosomeBreakage"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 being a direct cause of chromosome breakage indicates a direct causal link between the loss of BRCA2 and the occurrence of chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ DirectCause e1 ∧ Patient e1 ChromosomeBreakage ∧ Indicates e2 ∧ DirectCausalLink e2 ∧ Agent e2 LossOfBRCA2 ∧ Patient e2 ChromosomeBreakage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2(e)"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2(e) ∧ Cause(e) ∧ Patient(e, ChromosomeBreakage)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about LossOfBRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2(e)" <ATP>
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states Implies(A, B), where A is Loss of BRCA2 directly leading to chromosome breakage and B is there is a causal relationship between the loss of BRCA2 and chromosome breakage. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states Implies(C, D), where C is Loss of BRCA2 being a direct cause of chromosome breakage and D is a direct causal link between the loss of BRCA2 and the occurrence of chromosome breakage. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides the necessary link between LossOfBRCA2 and ChromosomeBreakage. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2(e) ∧ Cause(e) ∧ Patient(e, ChromosomeBreakage)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
