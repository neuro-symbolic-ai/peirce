(* Explanation 1: If a patient receives treatment with a MEK inhibitor, then there is no rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ ReceivesTreatmentMEK x e ⟶ ¬RapidRecoveryMAPK e"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient receives a combination treatment of Vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, it is expected to yield better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ ReceivesCombinationTreatmentVemurafenibMEK x e ⟶ ExpectedBetterResults e ∧ MonotherapyVemurafenib e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ReceivesCombinationTreatmentVemurafenibMEK x e"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
 shows "∃e. Yield e ∧ CombinationVemurafenibMEK e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ MonotherapyVemurafenib e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient receives a combination treatment of Vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ReceivesCombinationTreatmentVemurafenibMEK x e" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that if a patient receives a combination treatment of Vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, it is expected to yield better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical relation Implies(C, D), where C is the patient receives a combination treatment of Vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, and D is expected to yield better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* Since we have C from the premise, we can infer D. *)
  then have "ExpectedBetterResults e ∧ MonotherapyVemurafenib e" using explanation_2 by blast
  (* We need to show the existence of an event where there is a yield, combination treatment of Vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, better results, and Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* We can introduce a new event e that satisfies the required conditions. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ CombinationVemurafenibMEK e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ MonotherapyVemurafenib e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
