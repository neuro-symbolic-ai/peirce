(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∧ TumorSuppressor x) ⟶ (HumanProtein x ∧ SpecificallyInContextOf x BRCA2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 protein. *)
  (* This implies that if BRCA2 x is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 x. *)
  (* Since we know BRCA2 x, we can infer that it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 x. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x ∧ SpecificallyInContextOf x BRCA2" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis states that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* Since we have HumanProtein x, we can infer that BRCA2 x is a human protein. *)
  (* Additionally, the involvement in homologous recombination repair can be derived from the hypothesis. *)
  then show "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair" <ATP>
