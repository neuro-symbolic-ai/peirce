(* Explanation 1: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of single strand DNA damage implies the involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SingleStrand y ∧ DNADamage y ∧ Detects e ∧ Binds e ∧ Involvement e ∧ RecognitionRepair e ∧ Damage x"

(* Explanation 2: The detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of single strand DNA damage lead to its role in DNA damage recognition and repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. DetectionBinding x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Sites z ∧ SingleStrand z ∧ DNADamage z ∧ Lead e ∧ Role e ∧ RecognitionRepair e ∧ Damage x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SingleStrand y ∧ DNADamage y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in single strand DNA damage repair *)
 shows "∃e. InvolvedIn(e) ∧ RecognitionRepair(e) ∧ DNA(x) ∧ SingleStrand(y) ∧ Damage(y) ∧ Repair(e)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about PARP1, sites, single strand, and DNA damage. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SingleStrand y ∧ DNADamage y" by fastforce
  (* We have the logical proposition A: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of single strand DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PARP1 detects and binds to sites of single strand DNA damage, involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage) *)
  (* Since we have PARP1 detecting and binding to sites of single strand DNA damage, we can infer the involvement of PARP1 in the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn e ∧ RecognitionRepair e ∧ DNA x ∧ SingleStrand y ∧ Damage y ∧ Repair e" for e sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
