(* Explanation 1: Lapatinib and neratinib bind to the HER2 kinase domain and are therefore expected to have efficacy against tumors with these mutations in the kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. (Bind x HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Bind y HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Lapatinib x ∧ Neratinib y) ⟶ (Efficacy z ∧ Against z Tumors ∧ WithMutation z HER2KinaseDomain)"

(* Explanation 2: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain may overcome treatment resistance and be effective in breast cancer patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain ∧ (Overcome e ∧ TreatmentResistance e ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatients e BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 3: ERBB2 V777L is an inclusion criterion in 4 clinical trials for breast carcinoma, of which 4 are open and 0 are closed. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. ERBB2V777L x ∧ ClinicalTrial y ∧ ForDisease y BreastCarcinoma ∧ InclusionCriterion z ∧ InTrial z y ∧ Open y ∧ Closed y"

(* Explanation 4: Of the trials that contain ERBB2 V777L and breast carcinoma as inclusion criteria, 1 is phase 1/phase 2 (1 open) and 3 are phase 2 (3 open). *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z. (Contain x ERBB2V777L ∧ Contain x BreastCarcinoma ∧ InclusionCriterion y ∧ InTrial y x) ⟶ ((Phase1 x ∧ Phase2 x ∧ Open x) ∨ (Phase2 x ∧ Open x))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients may benefit from treatment with Neratinib or Lapatinib or may be able to access a clinical trial for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
 shows "∃x e1 e2 e3. Patient x ∧ (Benefit e1 ∧ WithTreatment e1 Neratinib ∧ ForTreatment e1 ERBB2V777L ∧ Access e2 ∧ ClinicalTrial e2 ∧ ForTreatment e2 ERBB2V777L ∧ Access e3 ∧ ClinicalTrial e3 ∧ ForTreatment e3 ERBB2V777L)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is seeking treatment. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that Lapatinib and neratinib bind to the HER2 kinase domain and are expected to have efficacy against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain. *)
  (* This implies that expected efficacy against tumors with mutations in the HER2 kinase domain leads to being effective in breast cancer patients. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient x may benefit from treatment with Neratinib or Lapatinib. *)
  then have "Benefit e1 ∧ WithTreatment e1 Neratinib ∧ ForTreatment e1 ERBB2V777L" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 3 and Explanation 4 provide information about ERBB2 V777L being an inclusion criterion in clinical trials for breast carcinoma. *)
  (* This implies that there are clinical trials available for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
  (* Therefore, the patient x may be able to access a clinical trial for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
  then have "Access e2 ∧ ClinicalTrial e2 ∧ ForTreatment e2 ERBB2V777L" <ATP>
  
  (* Similarly, the patient x may have access to another clinical trial for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
  then have "Access e3 ∧ ClinicalTrial e3 ∧ ForTreatment e3 ERBB2V777L" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above inferences, we have shown that there exist treatments and clinical trials available for the patient x. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
