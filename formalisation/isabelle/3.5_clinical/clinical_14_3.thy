(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans implies a specific relationship between two entities, x and y. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ Joining z ∧ Via z x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x ∧ InHumans x ⟶ Relationship y z"

(* Explanation 2: The promotion of repair molecule joining by BRCA2 involves a direct connection between the entities x and y. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ Joining z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ Connection y ∧ Direct y ∧ Between y x"

(* Explanation 3: Specifically, in x y is a consequence of the promotion of repair molecule joining by BRCA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PromotionOfJoiningByBRCA x ∧ RepairMolecule y ⟶ Consequence x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ InHumans z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about BRCA2, repair molecule, undamaged, and homologous. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y" and "Undamaged y" and "Homologous y" apply force
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(The promotion of repair molecule joining by BRCA2, a direct connection between the entities x and y) *)
  (* We can use explanatory sentence 2 to infer a direct connection between x and y. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain z e where "Joining e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" and "Connection y" and "Direct y" and "Between y x" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans, a specific relationship between two entities, x and y) *)
  (* We can use explanatory sentence 1 to infer a specific relationship between x and y. *)
  from explanation_1 have "Relationship y e" by (simp add: assms)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, E), Implies(The promotion of repair molecule joining by BRCA2, SpecificallyIn x y is a consequence) *)
  (* We can use explanatory sentence 3 to infer a consequence between x and y. *)
  from explanation_3 have "Consequence x y" sledgehammer
  (* Combining all the information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
