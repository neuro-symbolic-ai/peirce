(* Explanation 1: If a YAP inhibitor is effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, then it directly leads to the event of EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ BetaCateninActivity e ⟶ LeadsTo e (EffectiveInhibiting e)"

(* Explanation 2: The effectiveness of a YAP inhibitor in inhibiting β-catenin activity is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of the event EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ BetaCateninActivity e ⟶ SufficientCondition e (EffectiveInhibiting e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ BetaCateninActivity e"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ BetaCateninActivity e ∧ May e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about YAP inhibitor, effectiveness, inhibiting, and β-catenin activity. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ BetaCateninActivity e" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(YAP inhibitor is effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, EffectiveInhibiting e) *)
  (* Both A and B are from the explanatory sentences. *)
  (* Using the logical relation, we can infer EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
  then have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ BetaCateninActivity e ∧ May e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
