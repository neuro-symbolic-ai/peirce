(* Explanation 1: Patients with breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 should be treated with chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patients x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasNoExpressionOf x y ∧ ER x ∧ PR x ∧ HER2 x ∧ Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e"

(* Explanation 2: The absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression in breast cancer patients indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. AbsenceOfExpression x ∧ ER x ∧ PR x ∧ HER2 x ∧ BreastCancerPatients y ∧ In x y ∧ Indicate e ∧ Need e ∧ For e ChemotherapyTreatment"

(* Explanation 3: Chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for breast cancer patients lacking expression of ER, PR, or HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. Chemotherapy x ∧ RecommendedTreatment y ∧ ForPatients z ∧ BreastCancerPatients z ∧ LackingExpressionOf z ER ∧ LackingExpressionOf z PR ∧ LackingExpressionOf z HER"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x e. Patients x ∧ Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patients x" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentence 1 stating that patients with breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, treated with chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that if a patient has breast cancer and no expression of ER, PR, or HER2, they should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  (* Since we know the patient x, we can conclude that they should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  then have "∃e. Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
