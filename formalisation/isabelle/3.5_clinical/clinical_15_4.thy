(* Explanation 1: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. ((BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x) ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x) ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is involved in homologous recombination repair, then it is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x is either BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1. *)
  have "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x" sledgehammer
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), which states that if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  (* Since x is either BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1, and the second part of the antecedent is not given, we cannot directly infer InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot prove the hypothesis based on the given premise and explanations. *)
  (* The proof is inconclusive. *)
