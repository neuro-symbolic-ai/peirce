(* Explanation 1: PARP inhibitors are substances that inhibit the activity of PARP enzyme *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ⟶ Substances y ∧ InhibitActivityOfPARPEnzyme x y"

(* Explanation 2: Replication-associated double strand breaks are breaks in both strands of the DNA molecule that occur during DNA replication *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks x ⟶ BreaksInBothStrandsOfDNAMolecule y ∧ OccurDuringDNAReplication x y"

(* Explanation 3: Preventing single strand break repair is a process that stops the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 4: Defective homologous recombination repair is a mechanism where errors occur during the repair of DNA using homologous sequences *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 6: Repairing DNA involves fixing any damage or errors in the DNA molecule *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 7: The occurrence of double strand breaks leads to the activation of repair mechanisms *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
 shows "Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Manner e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PARP inhibitors, replication-associated double strand breaks, preventing single strand break repair, and defective homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x" and "ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y" and "PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z" and "DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, H), Implies(PARP inhibitors are substances that inhibit the activity of PARP enzyme, The repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks include preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error-prone non-homologous end joining) *)
  (* We can infer that PARP inhibitors are related to the repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks. *)
  then have "The repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks include preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error-prone non-homologous end joining" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* Since defective homologous recombination repair is one of the repair mechanisms involved, we can deduce that it is the cause. *)
  then have "Cause e" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* Additionally, we can derive the agent, patient, and manner from the premise. *)
  then have "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" and "Manner e z" by (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
