(* Explanation 1: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600EMutation z ∧ Receive e ∧ With e z ∧ For e z"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling was associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. RapidRecovery x ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling y ∧ Resistance z ∧ BRAFInhibitors z ∧ Associated e ∧ With e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling was associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors, Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation) *)
  (* We can infer that the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
