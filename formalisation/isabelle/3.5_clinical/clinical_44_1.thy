(* Explanation 1: CREBBP/BCORL1 reported in patients with ossifying myxoid tumour *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 2: Unknown relevance of CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. UnknownRelevance x ∧ CREBBP_BCORL1Fusion x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CREBBP_BCORL1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: CREBBP/BCORL1 potential role in cancer *)
 shows "RoleInCancer x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that CREBBP/BCORL1 x *)
  from asm have "CREBBP_BCORL1 x" sledgehammer
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating that CREBBP/BCORL1 reported in patients with ossifying myxoid tumour. *)
  (* This implies that if CREBBP/BCORL1 is reported in patients with ossifying myxoid tumour, it may have a potential role in cancer. *)
  (* However, the relevance of CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion is unknown, which does not directly imply a role in cancer. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot directly infer RoleInCancer x from the given information. *)
  (* We lack the necessary logical relation or implication to establish the connection between CREBBP/BCORL1 and its role in cancer. *)
  (* Hence, the proof cannot be completed with the provided information. *)
  (* Additional logical relations or implications are required to derive the hypothesis RoleInCancer x. *)
