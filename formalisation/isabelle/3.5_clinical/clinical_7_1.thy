(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor that is involved in chromosomal stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ BRCA2Protein x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* BRCA2 is related to logical proposition B and C. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein, BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor)*)
  (* Both B and C are from explanatory sentence 1 and 2, we can infer BRCA2 protein and its involvement in chromosomal stability. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ BRCA2Protein x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
