  IncreasedGenomicInstability :: "event ⇒ bool"

(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 can directly lead to increased genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Lead e ∧ IncreasedGenomicInstability e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ IncreasedGenomicInstability e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating Loss of BRCA2 can directly lead to increased genomic instability. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(A, B) to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Implies(A, B) implies Implies(Loss of BRCA2, increased genomic instability) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ IncreasedGenomicInstability e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
