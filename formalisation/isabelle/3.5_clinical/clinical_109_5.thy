(* Explanation 1: The presence implies the amplification of HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Presence x ∧ Amplification y ∧ HER y ⟶ Implies x y"

(* Explanation 2: The mutation V777L in HER2 is a type of mutation that leads to HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Mutation x ∧ HER2 y ∧ V777L x y ∧ Type z ∧ LeadsTo z y ⟶ Amplification y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y ∧ BreastCancer y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the mutation V777L in HER2 is a type of mutation that leads to HER2 amplification. *)
  (* This implies that if there is a mutation V777L in HER2, it leads to HER2 amplification. *)
  (* Given the hypothesis that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer, we can infer the existence of mutated and amplified entities. *)
  then have "∃y. Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y" sledgehammer
  (* Since the patient has breast cancer, we can also infer the existence of breast cancer entity. *)
  then have "∃y. Patient x ∧ Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y ∧ BreastCancer y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
