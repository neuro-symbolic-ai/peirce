(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (HomologousRecombinationRepair x)"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules x (SisterChromatids x) (PaternalCopies x) (MaternalCopies x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA repair via homologous recombination repair *)
  shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x) ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* BRCA2 is related to logical proposition A. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair, homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA repair via homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x) ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
