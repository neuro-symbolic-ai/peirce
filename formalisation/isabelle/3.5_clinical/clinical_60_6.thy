(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if x is involved in HRR, then x is involved in HRR in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. InvolvedInHRR x ⟶ InvolvedInHRRInHumans x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is involved in the process of HRR, then it is involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedInProcessOfHRR x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
 (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHRR x ∧ Human x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 x" apply simp
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have Implies(C, A), Implies(an entity is involved in the process of HRR, x is involved in HRR) *)
  (* Both BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x are involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR x" by (simp add: assms)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we have ForAll(x, Implies(A, B)), ForAll(x, if x is involved in HRR, then x is involved in HRR in humans) *)
  (* Since BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x are involved in HRR, they are involved in HRR in humans. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRRInHumans x" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x are involved in HRR and are humans. *)
  then show "InvolvedInHRR x ∧ Human x" <ATP>
