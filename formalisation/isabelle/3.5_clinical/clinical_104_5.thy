(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e. HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Located x IntracellularKinaseDomain ∧ Not(Contribute e) ∧ Patient e TrastuzumabResistance ∧ BindsTo w Trastuzumab ExtracellularKinaseDomain"

(* Explanation 2: The resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ResistanceInducedBy x HER2ActivatingMutation ∧ Not(Related e) ∧ Patient e HER2V777L"

(* Explanation 3: There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Identify e ∧ Mechanism x ∧ ThroughWhich e x ∧ HER2V777L x ∧ LeadTo e ∧ Patient e TreatmentResistance ∧ ToTrastuzumab e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Targeting(x, HERV777L, y, z) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y)"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting(x, HERV777L, y, z) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y) ∧ Overcome(e) ∧ Patient(e, TreatmentResistance)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about targeting the HER V777L mutation and using an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Targeting(x, HERV777L, y, z) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, Not(trastuzumab resistance)) *)
  (* We know that the HER2 V777L mutation may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  (* This implies that targeting the HER V777L mutation may help overcome trastuzumab resistance. *)
  then have "Overcome(e)" <ATP>
  (* We have shown that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor can overcome treatment resistance. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
