(* Explanation 1: PARP1's synthesis of PAR, which recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage, is crucial for its involvement in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. PARP1 x ∧ Synthesis e1 ∧ PAR y ∧ Recruits e2 ∧ Proteins z ∧ Sites z ∧ CrucialFor e1 e2 ∧ Involvement e2 ∧ Recognition e2 ∧ Repair e2 ∧ DNA y ∧ Damage y ∧ In e2 x ∧ SS y"

(* Explanation 2: The detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of SS DNA damage play a significant role in its participation in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Detection e1 ∧ Binding e2 ∧ PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SS y ∧ DNA z ∧ Damage z ∧ SignificantRole e1 ∧ Participation e2 ∧ Recognition e2 ∧ Repair e2 ∧ In e1 x ∧ In e2 x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ DNA y ∧ Damage y ∧ SS y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
 shows "∃x e. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvedIn e ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ In e x ∧ SS y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about PARP1, DNA, Damage, and SS. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" and "DNA y" and "Damage y" and "SS y" apply simp
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(The detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of SS DNA damage play a significant role in its participation in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair, PARP1 recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage) *)
  (* Both C and B are from explanatory sentence 2 and 1 respectively. *)
  (* We can infer that PARP1 recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn e ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ In e x" for some e apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We have shown that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
