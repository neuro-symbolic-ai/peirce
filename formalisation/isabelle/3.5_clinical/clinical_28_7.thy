(* Explanation 1: An activating mutation in CTNNB1 is present in the patient with hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x CTNNB1 ∧ Patient y ∧ With y Hepatoblastoma"

(* Explanation 2: The patient with hepatoblastoma has an activating mutation in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ With x Hepatoblastoma ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In y x ∧ CTNNB y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has an activating mutation y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(activating mutation in CTNNB1 is present in the patient with hepatoblastoma, patient with hepatoblastoma has an activating mutation in CTNNB) *)
  (* Since we have an activating mutation in CTNNB1 present in the patient with hepatoblastoma, we can infer that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
