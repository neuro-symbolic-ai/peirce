(* Explanation 1: There exists an event where the patient with TNBC had a stable disease after treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y z. Event e ∧ Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x y ∧ Time e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" <ATP>
  (* Given the explanation sentence, we have the information about an event where the patient with TNBC had a stable disease after treatment. *)
  (* We can extract the necessary information from this event. *)
  obtain e y z where event_info: "Event e ∧ Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z" <ATP>
  (* We can now use the extracted information to prove the hypothesis. *)
  from event_info have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
