(* Explanation 1: Adding an explanatory sentence specifying a link between ossifying myxoid tumour and cancer could help establish a potential connection between CREBBP/BCORL1 and cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. ExplanatorySentence x ∧ Linking y ∧ OssifyingMyxoidTumour z ∧ Cancer e ∧ HelpEstablish e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e y ∧ SpecifiesLink z e"

(* Explanation 2: Including an explanatory sentence indicating the general association between gene fusions and cancer development may provide a basis for inferring the potential role of CREBBP/BCORL1 in cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ExplanatorySentence x ∧ Linking y ∧ Association z ∧ GeneFusions e ∧ CancerDevelopment e ∧ ProvideBasis e ∧ Agent x e ∧ Purpose x y ∧ InferringRole z e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CREBBPBCORL1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: CREBBP/BCORL1 potential role in cancer *)
 shows "RoleInCancer x"
proof -
  (* We have the known information that CREBBP/BCORL1 x. *)
  from asm have "CREBBPBCORL1 x" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentence 1 linking ossifying myxoid tumour and cancer to help establish a potential connection between CREBBP/BCORL1 and cancer. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(explanatory sentence specifying a link between ossifying myxoid tumour and cancer, potential connection between CREBBP/BCORL1 and cancer) *)
  (* As we have CREBBP/BCORL1 x, we can infer the potential connection between CREBBP/BCORL1 and cancer. *)
  then have "RoleInCancer x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
