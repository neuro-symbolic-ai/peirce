(* Explanation 1: The effectiveness of a specific Notch inhibitor in treating the given patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations suggests a potential effectiveness of Notch inhibitors in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Effectiveness x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ Patient z ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Potential e1 ∧ InTreat e1 z ∧ With e1 z ∧ Suggests e2 ∧ Of e2 x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e y ∧ With e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the Notch inhibitor, patient, and CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  from asm have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating the relationship between the effectiveness of a specific Notch inhibitor in treating the given patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations and the potential effectiveness of Notch inhibitors in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* This implies that if a specific Notch inhibitor is effective in treating a patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations, it suggests the potential effectiveness of Notch inhibitors in treating such patients. *)
  (* Since we have the premise about the Notch inhibitor, patient, and CTNNB1 mutation, we can infer the activation and effectiveness. *)
  then have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e y ∧ With e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
