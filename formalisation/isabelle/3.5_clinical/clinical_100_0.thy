(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRAF x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Play e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Involve e x MAPK_ERK)"

(* Explanation 2: The MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. MAPK_ERK x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ⟶ Affect e ∧ Involve e x ∧ Involve e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
 shows "∃e x y z. BRAF x ∧ Role y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Play e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Involve e y ∧ Involve e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x is true. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRAF is a proto-oncogene, BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway). *)
  (* This implies that BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Play e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Involve e x MAPK_ERK)" <ATP>
  (* Now, we have the involvement of BRAF in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  (* We also have the explanation that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* This implies that BRAF, through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "∃e x y z. BRAF x ∧ Role y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Play e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Involve e y ∧ Involve e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
