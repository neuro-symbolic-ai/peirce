(* Explanation 1: The best known genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. GeneticAlterations x ⟶ ActivatingPointMutation x ∧ At x PI3K"

(* Explanation 2: In breast cancer, mutations of the PIK3CA gene are highly frequent. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. BreastCancer x ∧ PIK3CA y ⟶ HighlyFrequent x ∧ Mutation x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3CA x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3CA x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3CA x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(mutations of the PIK3CA gene in breast cancer are highly frequent, genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K) *)
  (* We can infer that PIK3CA x is highly frequent and leads to activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
  then have "ActivatingPointMutation x ∧ At x PI3K ∧ HighlyFrequent x" sledgehammer
  (* From the above inference, we can conclude that PIK3CA x is an activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
