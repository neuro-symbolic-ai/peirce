(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (HomologousRecombinationRepair x)"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ ((DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules x (SisterChromatids x)) ∨ (DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules x (PaternalMaternalCopiesOfChromosomes x)))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA break repair via homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x (DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, homologous recombination repair is a double-strand break DNA repair process) *)
  (* We can infer that homologous recombination repair is a double-strand break DNA repair process. *)
  then have "HomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(homologous recombination repair is a double-strand break DNA repair process, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules) *)
  (* We can infer that damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  then have "DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules x (SisterChromatids x) ∨ DamagedDNAReplacedByUndamagedHomologousMolecules x (PaternalMaternalCopiesOfChromosomes x)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules, undamaged homologous molecules come from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* We can infer that undamaged homologous molecules come from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x x (DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x)" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above inferences, we have proven the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
