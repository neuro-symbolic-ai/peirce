(* Explanation 1: If a patient has TNBC, then the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Patient x ∧ TNBC y ⟶ (NotAppropriate y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PatientWithTNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∃x y. PatientWithTNBC x ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ PARPInhibitors y ∧ SecondLineTherapy y ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "PatientWithTNBC x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that if a patient has TNBC, then the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* We can derive the implication Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(a patient has TNBC, Not(the patient is appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors)) *)
  (* Since the patient has TNBC, we can infer that the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "NotAppropriate y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis states that the patient with TNBC is not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy. *)
  (* We need to show the existence of x and y such that the patient with TNBC is not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy. *)
  (* We can combine the information we have to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then have "PatientWithTNBC x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ PARPInhibitors y ∧ SecondLineTherapy y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
