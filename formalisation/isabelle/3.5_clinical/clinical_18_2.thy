(* Explanation 1: The occurrence of homologous recombination repair and double-strand break DNA repair process in an event implies that damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. HomologousRecombinationRepair e1 ∧ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess e1 ∧ Event e2 ⟶ DamagedDNAReplaced e2 ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules e2 ∧ SisterChromatids e2 ∧ PaternalCopies e2 ∧ MaternalCopies e2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Event e"
  (* Hypothesis: homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "∃e. HomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess e ∧ DamagedDNAReplaced e ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules e ∧ SisterChromatids e ∧ PaternalCopies e ∧ MaternalCopies e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the event. *)
  from asm have "Event e" by simp
  (* The hypothesis involves the occurrence of homologous recombination repair and double-strand break DNA repair process. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(occurrence of homologous recombination repair and double-strand break DNA repair process in an event, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* We can infer the components of B from the occurrence of A. *)
  then have "HomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess e ∧ DamagedDNAReplaced e ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules e ∧ SisterChromatids e ∧ PaternalCopies e ∧ MaternalCopies e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
