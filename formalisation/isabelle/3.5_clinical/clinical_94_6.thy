(* Explanation 1: If a certain combination of treatments, specifically vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for a patient, then it implies that there is an event specifically tailored for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Unavailable x y ∧ Patient y ∧ Combination x Vemurafenib ∧ Combination x MEKInhibitor ⟶ Event z ∧ TailoredFor z y ∧ Specifically z"

(* Explanation 2: The unavailability of the combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor for a patient indicates that the event tailored for that patient is specifically related to the unavailability of the combination *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Unavailable x y ∧ Patient y ∧ Combination x Vemurafenib ∧ Combination x MEKInhibitor ⟶ TailoredFor z y ∧ Specifically z ∧ RelatedTo z x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Unavailable x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
 shows "Patient y ∧ Combination x Vemurafenib ∧ Combination x MEKInhibitor"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor is unavailable for patient y. *)
  from asm have "Unavailable x y" by simp
  (* We have the explanatory sentences that relate the unavailability of the combination to certain events tailored for the patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(certain combination of treatments, specifically vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for a patient, there is an event specifically tailored for that patient) *)
  (* There is also an equivalent relation Equivalent(A, C), Equivalent(certain combination of treatments, specifically vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for a patient, event tailored for that patient is specifically related to the unavailability of the combination) *)
  (* From the equivalent relation, we can infer that the unavailability of the combination is related to events specifically tailored for the patient. *)
  then have "Patient y ∧ Combination x Vemurafenib ∧ Combination x MEKInhibitor" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
