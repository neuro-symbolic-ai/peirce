(* Explanation 1: Specify that the patient's mutation status includes the known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ⟶ Specify x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the patient, mutation, known mutation, V777L mutation, and HER2 mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y" by auto
  (* Given the explanatory sentence, we know that the patient's mutation status includes the known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  (* This can be represented as: ∀x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ⟶ Specify x y *)
  (* Since we have Patient x, Mutation y, Known y, V777L y, and HER2 y, we can infer Specify x y. *)
  then have "Specify x y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* The hypothesis includes the patient having a known V777L HER 2 mutation, which is equivalent to the patient having the mutation specified by x and y. *)
  then have "Has x y" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists x and y such that the patient has the specified mutation. *)
