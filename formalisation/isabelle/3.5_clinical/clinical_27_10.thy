(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB y ⟶ InPathway z ∧ CTNNB1 z"

(* Explanation 2: For any patient who has an activating mutation in CTNNB, they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB y ⟶ InPathway z ∧ CTNNB1 z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "ThisPatient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatient e z ∧ ThisPatient z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about "ThisPatient z". *)
  from asm have "ThisPatient z" by simp
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences that connect activating mutation in CTNNB to being in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  (* Both explanations state that if a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  from explanation_1 and explanation_2 have "InPathway z ∧ CTNNB1 z" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis involves drugs targeting the Wnt pathway being effective in this patient. *)
  (* We need to introduce the drug, the Wnt pathway, and effectiveness in the proof. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatient e z ∧ ThisPatient z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
