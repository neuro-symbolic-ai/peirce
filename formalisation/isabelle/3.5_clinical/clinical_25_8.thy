(* Explanation 1: The statement "May e" directly implies the event "EffectiveInhibiting e" according to the given explanation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Statement e ∧ May e ⟶ (Implies e ∧ Event e e ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ AccordingTo e ∧ GivenExplanation e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
 shows "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that YAPInhibitor x and βCateninActivity y are true. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x" and "βCateninActivity y" apply simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(May e, EffectiveInhibiting e). *)
  (* Given the explanation that "May e" implies "EffectiveInhibiting e", we can infer EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
  then have "EffectiveInhibiting e" by (simp add: assms)
  (* We need to show the existence of x, y, and e such that the desired properties hold. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
