(* Explanation 1: Patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are characterized by the absence of HER-2 expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patients x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ⟶ AbsenceOfExpression y HER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that Patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are characterized by the absence of HER-2 expression. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition B: absence of HER-2 expression. *)
  (* We can infer the absence of HER-2 expression for the patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. *)
  then have "AbsenceOfExpression y HER2" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* The hypothesis involves NoExpression y ER, NoExpression y PR, and NoExpression y HER2. *)
  (* Since we have already established the absence of HER-2 expression, we can include it in the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2" sledgehammer
