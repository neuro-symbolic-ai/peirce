(* Explanation 1: PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110, of which p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. CatalyticSubunit x p110 ∧ TranscribedFrom y p110α PIK3CA ∧ SubunitOf z p110 PI3K ⟶ TranscribedFrom y p110α z"

(* Explanation 2: Activating mutations of the p110α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) have been identified in a broad spectrum of tumors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. ActivatingMutation x ∧ SubunitOf x p110α PI3K ∧ GeneOf x PIK3CA ∧ Tumor y ⟶ IdentifiedIn x y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ MutationOf x y PIK3CA ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn y BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient likely has activating mutation of p110α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) *)
 shows "∃x. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x p110α ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ SubunitOf x p110α PI3K ∧ GeneOf x PIK3CA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ MutationOf x y PIK3CA ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn y BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation, activating PIK3Ca mutation is seen frequently in breast cancer) *)
  (* We can infer that the activating mutation seen in the patient is frequently associated with breast cancer. *)
  (* Since the activating mutation is associated with breast cancer, we can deduce that it is related to the PIK3CA gene. *)
  (* From Explanation 3, we can infer that the patient has a mutation related to PIK3CA. *)
  then obtain z where "Patient x ∧ MutationOf x z PIK3CA" <ATP>
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that activating mutations of the p110α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) have been identified in a broad spectrum of tumors. *)
  (* Since the patient has an activating mutation, we can deduce that it is related to the p110α subunit of PI3K. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ HasMutation x p110α ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ SubunitOf x p110α PI3K ∧ GeneOf x PIK3CA" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
