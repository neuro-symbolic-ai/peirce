(* Explanation 1: PARP1 is a poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase, which modifies various nuclear proteins by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PARP1 x ⟶ (PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ (∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ VariousNuclearProteins x))"

(* Explanation 2: Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation… is dependent on DNA and is involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and tumor transformation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. PolyADPribosylation x ⟶ (DependentOn x DNA ∧ InvolvedIn x CellularProcesses ∧ InvolvedIn x Differentiation ∧ InvolvedIn x Proliferation ∧ InvolvedIn x TumorTransformation)"

(* Explanation 3: Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation… is involved in… the regulation of the molecular events involved in the recovery of cell from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. PolyADPribosylation x ⟶ (∃e. InvolvedIn e x ∧ InvolvedIn e RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage ∧ InvolvedIn e MolecularEvents)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferse which, via polyADP-riosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
 shows "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ ∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ VariousNuclearProteins x ∧ InvolvedIn e CellularProcesses ∧ InvolvedIn e RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP1 is related to PolyADPribosylTransferse and modifies various nuclear proteins. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ⟶ (PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ (∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ VariousNuclearProteins x))" by (rule explanation_1)
  (* We have the derived implication Implies(A, D), Implies(PARP1 is a polytransferase, Polyation is involved in the regulation of the molecular events involved in the recovery of cell from DNA damage) *)
  (* Since PARP1 is a polytransferase, we can infer that it is involved in the regulation of the molecular events involved in the recovery of cell from DNA damage. *)
  then have "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ ∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ VariousNuclearProteins x ∧ InvolvedIn e RecoveryOfCellFromDNADamage" by (rule ImpliesD)
  (* We also have the derived implication Implies(A, C), Implies(PARP1 is a polytransferase, Polyation is involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes) *)
  (* As PARP1 is a polytransferase, we can infer that it is involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes. *)
  then have "PolyADPribosylTransferse x ∧ ∃e. Modifies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ VariousNuclearProteins x ∧ InvolvedIn e CellularProcesses" by (rule ImpliesD)
