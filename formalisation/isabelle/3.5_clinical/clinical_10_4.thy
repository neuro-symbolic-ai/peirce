(* Explanation 1: Specify that the detection and binding of PARP1 to sites of single strand DNA damage directly result in its involvement in the recognition and repair of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Detection x ∧ Binding y ∧ PARP1 x ∧ SingleStrand y ∧ DNADamage e ∧ Result e ∧ Involvement e ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e"

(* Explanation 2: Add a statement that explicitly connects the detection and binding of PARP1 to its role in DNA damage recognition and repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Statement x ∧ Connects e ∧ Explicitly e ∧ Detection y ∧ Binding y ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Role e ∧ DNADamage e ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e"

(* Explanation 3: Include a statement that clarifies the relationship between the detection and binding of PARP1 and its involvement in DNA damage recognition and repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. Statement x ∧ Clarifies e ∧ Relationship e ∧ Detection y ∧ Binding y ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Involvement e ∧ DNADamage e ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Detection x ∧ Binding y ∧ SingleStrand z"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in single strand DNA damage repair *)
 shows "∃e. Involvement e ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ DNADamage e ∧ SingleStrand z ∧ Repair e"
