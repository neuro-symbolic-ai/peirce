(* Explanation 1: The entity z is related to the plasma membrane *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀z. Entity z ⟶ RelatedTo z PlasmaMembrane"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Entity z"
  (* Hypothesis: Binding of the p85 subunit and p110 relieves inhibition of p110 and mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane *)
 shows "∃x y e1 e2. P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y ∧ Relieves e1 ∧ Mediates e2 ∧ InhibitionOfP110 z ∧ RecruitmentOfPI3K z ∧ To z PlasmaMembrane"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that entity z is related to the plasma membrane. *)
  from asm have "Entity z" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states the entity z is related to the plasma membrane. *)
  (* We can infer that z is related to the plasma membrane. *)
  from explanation_1 have "RelatedTo z PlasmaMembrane" using assms by blast
  (* We need to prove the hypothesis which involves various conditions. *)
  (* We can instantiate the variables with the necessary conditions. *)
  have "P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y ∧ Relieves e1 ∧ Mediates e2 ∧ InhibitionOfP110 z ∧ RecruitmentOfPI3K z ∧ To z PlasmaMembrane" sledgehammer
