(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is related to the manner in which e acts *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ (RecoveryProcess x ∧ RelatedTo x MannerOfActing)"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ (RecoveryProcess x ∧ DependentOn x (Role PARP1 (DNARepair)))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors e ∧ Target(e, TumourSpecificDefects) ∧ DNARepair TumourSpecificDefects"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e. Inhibitors(e) ∧ Target(e, TumourSpecificDefects) ∧ DNARepair(TumourSpecificDefects) ∧ Role(PARP1, Recover) ∧ From(PARP1, DNARepair)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors. *)
  have "Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e e" <ATP>
  (* Using the logical relations Implies(A, B) and Implies(A, C) from the explanations. *)
  (* We can infer that the recovery process is related to the manner of acting and dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair. *)
  from explanation_1[rule_format, of e e] and explanation_2[rule_format, of e e] and ‹Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e e›
  have "RecoveryProcess e ∧ RelatedTo e MannerOfActing" and "RecoveryProcess e ∧ DependentOn e (Role PARP1 DNARepair)" by auto
  (* We already know that the recovery process is related to the manner of acting and dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis by including the given information. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
