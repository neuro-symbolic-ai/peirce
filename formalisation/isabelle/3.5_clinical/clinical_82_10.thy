(* Explanation 1: Specify that the treatment received by the patient with TNBC is chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 2: Specify that the treatment received is the first-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Treatment x ∧ Received x ⟶ FirstLineTreatment x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ StableDisease y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ After e z"
