(* Explanation 1: A patient who is less sensitive to chemotherapy is more likely to have previously received endocrine therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ ChemotherapySensitive y ∧ Less y ∧ Is e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y x ∧ MoreLikely z ∧ Previously z ∧ Receive z ∧ Agent x z ∧ Patient z"

(* Explanation 2: Patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y x ∧ MoreLikely z ∧ Exhibit z ∧ ReducedSensitivity z ∧ Chemotherapy z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient y x ∧ Previously y"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient y e ∧ Previously e ∧ BenefitFrom z ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ Target z PIK3CA_mutation"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about the patient, endocrine therapy, and receiving treatment. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient y x ∧ Previously y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(patient has received endocrine therapy, patient exhibits reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2, we can infer ReducedSensitivity. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient y e ∧ Previously e ∧ BenefitFrom z ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ Target z PIK3CA_mutation" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
