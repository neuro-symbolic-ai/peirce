(* Explanation 1: The activating mutation in CTNNB1 is specifically caused by the mutation W25_H36del *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x CTNNB1 ⟶ (CausedBy y x ∧ W25_H36del y)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient implies the presence of the activating mutation in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Hepatoblastoma x ∧ Patient y ⟶ (Implies x y ∧ (∃z. ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that states the presence of hepatoblastoma implies the presence of the activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(presence of hepatoblastoma, activating mutation in CTNNB1) *)
  (* Since the patient x is a patient, and the presence of hepatoblastoma implies the activating mutation in CTNNB, we can infer the activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "∃z. ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB" sledgehammer
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states the activating mutation in CTNNB1 is specifically caused by the mutation W25_H36del. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(mutation W25_H36del, activating mutation in CTNNB1) *)
  (* Since we have the activating mutation in CTNNB1, we can infer the mutation W25_H36del. *)
  then have "∃z. ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB ∧ CTNNB1 z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
