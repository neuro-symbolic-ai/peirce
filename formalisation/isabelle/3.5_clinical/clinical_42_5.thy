(* Explanation 1: The potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. CREBBP x ∧ Cancer y ∧ RoleIn x y ∧ LeadsTo z ∧ Directly z ∧ Relevance z NCT03568656 ∧ ForPatient z y"

(* Explanation 2: For a patient to be relevant, there must be a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Relevant x ⟶ (∃e. CausalLink e ∧ Between e (RoleIn x y) (Relevance z NCT03568656))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. NCT03568656(x) ∧ Patient(y) ∧ Relevant(x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient y is relevant. *)
  from asm have "Patient y ∧ Relevant y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, C), Implies(causal link between A and B, patient is relevant) *)
  (* We can infer that there is a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  (* Since the patient y is relevant, there must be a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  then obtain e where "CausalLink e ∧ Between e (RoleIn y Cancer) (Relevance e NCT03568656)" <ATP>
  (* From the causal link, we can conclude that NCT03568656 is relevant for the patient y. *)
  then have "NCT03568656(x) ∧ Patient(y) ∧ Relevant x" for x
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
