(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x x)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ BRCA2Protein x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 protein is involved in HRR) *)
  (* Both A and D are from explanatory sentences. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that BRCA2 protein is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "BRCA2Protein x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x" sledgehammer
  (* We already have BRCA2 x, and we have inferred BRCA2Protein x and InvolvedInHRR x. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
