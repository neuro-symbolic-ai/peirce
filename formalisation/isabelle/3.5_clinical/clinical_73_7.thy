(* Explanation 1: If an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (Has x y ∧ Patient x ∧ ActivatingPIK3CaMutation y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Has x y ∧ ActivatingPIK3CaMutation y ∧ Patient x) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 3: The activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. ActivatingPIK3CaMutation x ∧ Patient y ∧ SeenFrequently x BreastCancer"  (* Corrected the syntax error *)

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingPIK3CaMutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ ActivatingPIK3CaMutation(y) ∧ Has(x, y) ∧ SeenFrequently(y, BreastCancer)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the entity x is a patient and entity y has an activating PIK3Ca mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingPIK3CaMutation y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient, activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue) *)
  (* We can infer that the activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue. *)
  then have "SeenFrequently y BreastCancer" <ATP>
  (* Since we have Patient x and ActivatingPIK3CaMutation y, we can conclude that there exists x and y such that Patient(x) ∧ ActivatingPIK3CaMutation(y) ∧ Has(x, y) ∧ SeenFrequently(y, BreastCancer). *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
