(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BRAF x ∧ ProtoOncogene y ∧ Role z ∧ MAPK_ERK_Signaling_Pathway z ∧ Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e z"

(* Explanation 2: The MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. MAPK_ERK_Signaling_Pathway x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ⟶ Affects x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRAF x ∧ Role y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e y ∧ Purpose e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRAF is a proto-oncogene, BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "∃y z e. Role y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e y ∧ Purpose e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
