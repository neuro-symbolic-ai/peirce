(* Explanation 1: ∀e1 e2. Joining(e1) ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules(e1) ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair(e1) ∧ In(e1, e2) ⟶ Joining(e2) ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules(e2) *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. Joining e1 ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e1 ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e1 ∧ In e1 e2 ⟶ Joining e2 ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e2"

(* Explanation 2: ∀e. PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules(e) ⟶ ConsequenceOf(e) ∧ LossOfBRCA(e) *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules e ⟶ ConsequenceOf e ∧ LossOfBRCA e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Joining e1 ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e1 ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e1"
  (* Hypothesis: LossOfBRCA2(e) ∧ Prevents(e) ∧ Joining(e1) ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules(e1) ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair(e1) ∧ In(e1, e) *)
 shows "In e1 e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about loss of BRCA2, prevention, joining undamaged repair molecules, and homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Joining e1 ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e1 ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e1" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair, prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have Joining e1 and UndamagedRepairMolecules e1, so we can infer In e1 e. *)
  then have "In e1 e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
