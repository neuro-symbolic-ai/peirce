(* Explanation 1: If inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, then it inhibits β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. (EffectiveInTreatment e ∧ PatientsWithMutation e) ⟶ InhibitBetaCatenin e"

(* Explanation 2: If inhibiting β-catenin, then it is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. InhibitBetaCatenin e ⟶ (EffectiveInTreatment e ∧ PatientsWithMutation e)"

(* Explanation 3: For any event where inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, it also inhibits β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e. (EffectiveInTreatment e ∧ PatientsWithMutation e) ⟶ InhibitBetaCatenin e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PatientsWithMutation x"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃e. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ EffectiveInTreatment e ∧ PatientsWithMutation e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PatientsWithMutation x. *)
  from asm have "PatientsWithMutation x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, inhibits β-catenin) *)
  (* We can infer that if inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, then it inhibits β-catenin. *)
  then have "InhibitBetaCatenin x ∧ EffectiveInTreatment x ∧ PatientsWithMutation x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
