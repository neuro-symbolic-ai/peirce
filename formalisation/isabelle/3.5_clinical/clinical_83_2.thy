(* Explanation 1: Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Received z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y"

(* Explanation 2: Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. VinorelbineCisplatin x ⟶ ChemotherapyTreatment x"

(* Explanation 3: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Treated y ∧ Agent y x"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
  from asm obtain a b c where "Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine b ∧ Cisplatin c ∧ FirstLineTreatment c ∧ Received c ∧ Agent c x ∧ Patient c a" by (rule explanation_1)
  (* We have the information that vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
  from explanation_2 have "VinorelbineCisplatin b ⟶ ChemotherapyTreatment b"
  (* Since the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin, which is a chemotherapy treatment, we can infer that the patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_3 and ‹Patient x› obtain d where "Chemotherapy d ∧ Treated d ∧ Agent d x"
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude that the patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ Received d ∧ Agent d x ∧ Patient d a"
