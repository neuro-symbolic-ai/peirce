(* Explanation 1: The repair of DNA occurs when there is a patient affected by the prevention of SS break repair, leading to the repair of DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. RepairDNA x ∧ Patient y ∧ Preventing e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient z ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ LeadingTo e2 ∧ Patient x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs by preventing SS break repair, relying on defective HRR and error prone NHEJ to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y ∧ Preventing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient z ∧ RepairDNA z ∧ RelyingOn e DefectiveHRR ∧ RelyingOn e ErrorProneNHEJ"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP inhibitors are related to causing ReplicationAssociatedDSBs. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(patient affected by the prevention of SS break repair, repair of DNA) *)
  (* We can infer that PARP inhibitors cause ReplicationAssociatedDSBs by preventing SS break repair. *)
  then have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDSBs y ∧ Preventing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient z ∧ RepairDNA z" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis also mentions relying on DefectiveHRR and ErrorProneNHEJ to repair DNA. *)
  (* However, these are not directly related to the known information. *)
