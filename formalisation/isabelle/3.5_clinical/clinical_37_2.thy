(* Explanation 1: If CFI-402257 is suitable for a patient, then the patient will not have to travel *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e1 e2. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suitable e1 ∧ Is e1 ⟶ (¬(Have e2 ∧ Will e2 ∧ Travel e2 ∧ Agent e2 y))"

(* Explanation 2: If CFI-402257 is not suitable for a patient, then the patient will have to travel *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotSuitable e1 ∧ Is e1 ⟶ (Have e2 ∧ Will e2 ∧ Travel e2 ∧ Agent e2 y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Have e ∧ Will e ∧ Travel e ∧ MayNotBeSuitable x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1: If CFI-402257 is suitable for a patient, then the patient will not have to travel. *)
  (* Explanation 2: If CFI-402257 is not suitable for a patient, then the patient will have to travel. *)
  (* We can derive the following implications from the explanations and logical relations: *)
  (* Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(Not(A), C), Implies(Not(C), Not(B)), Implies(B, C) *)
  (* Combining these implications, we can infer that if CFI-402257 is not suitable for a patient, the patient will have to travel. *)
  then have "∃e. Have e ∧ Will e ∧ Travel e ∧ MayNotBeSuitable x" sledgehammer
