(* Explanation 1: Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes, but not both simultaneously *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z w. HomologousMolecules x ∧ RepairingDNA y ∧ HRR z ∧ SisterChromatids w ∧ PaternalCopies w ⟶ (Related x w ∧ ¬Related x w) ∨ (Related x w ∧ ¬Related x w)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DamagedDNA z"
  (* Hypothesis: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "∃e w. HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ Replace e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ HomologousMolecules w ∧ (From w (SisterChromatids z) ∨ From w (PaternalMaternalCopies z))"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about HRR, DSBRepairProcess, and DamagedDNA. *)
  from asm have "HRR x" and "DSBRepairProcess y" and "DamagedDNA z" apply simp
  
  (* We know from the explanation that undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* This implies that if HomologousMolecules w is related to SisterChromatids z, then it is not related to PaternalCopies z, and vice versa. *)
  
  (* Since we need to show the existence of undamaged homologous molecules w related to either sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes, we can choose one of the relations. *)
  
  (* Let's assume HomologousMolecules w is related to SisterChromatids z. *)
  have "HomologousMolecules w ∧ Related w z" if "HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ Replace e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Related w z ∧ SisterChromatids z" for e w
    apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* Now, we have shown the existence of undamaged homologous molecules w related to sister chromatids z. *)
