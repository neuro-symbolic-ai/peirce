(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are in the CTNNB1 pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation e1 ∧ In e1 y ∧ CTNNB y ⟶ InCTNNB1Pathway e2 ∧ In e2 x ∧ CTNNB1Pathway x"

(* Explanation 2: For any patient who has an activating mutation in CTNNB, they are in the CTNNB1 pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation e ∧ In e y ∧ CTNNB y ⟶ InCTNNB1Pathway e ∧ In e x ∧ CTNNB1Pathway x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "ThisPatient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatient e z ∧ ThisPatient z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about ThisPatient z. *)
  from asm have "ThisPatient z" by simp
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences about patients with activating mutations in CTNNB being in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations to infer that if a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  (* This information is crucial for the hypothesis that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a drug, a target, a pathway, an effectiveness event, a patient event, and the specific patient z. *)
