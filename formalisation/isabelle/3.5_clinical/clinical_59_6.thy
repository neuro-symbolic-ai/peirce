(* Explanation 1: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. BindingPartner x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ BRCA2 z ⟶ SpecificallyRequiredFor x (Localization z SitesOfDNADamage)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ Encodes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z SitesOfDNADamage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about PALB2, binding partner, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z" <ATP>
  (* We know from the explanatory sentence that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition A. *)
  (* We can infer the required relationships to prove the hypothesis. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "SpecificallyRequiredFor y (Localization z SitesOfDNADamage)" <ATP>
  (* We can now construct the required elements to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ Encodes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z SitesOfDNADamage" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
