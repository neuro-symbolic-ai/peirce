(* Explanation 1: The repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks, such as preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error-prone non-homologous end joining, are causally linked to the occurrence of DNA repair errors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y z. DoubleStrandBreaks x ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair y ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair z ⟶ (Cause e x ∧ RepairMechanism e ∧ InvolvedIn e x ∧ InvolvedIn e y ∧ InvolvedIn e z ∧ CausallyLinked e)"

(* Explanation 2: Defective homologous recombination repair is specifically triggered by the repair mechanisms responding to double strand breaks, indicating a direct causal relationship between the two processes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x y. DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ RepairMechanism y ∧ DoubleStrandBreaks e ⟶ (Trigger e x ∧ By e y ∧ DirectCausalRelationship e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃e x y z. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ⟶ (Cause e y ∧ By e x ∧ RepairMechanism e ∧ DNARepairErrors z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP inhibitors are involved. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x" <ATP>
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks) *)
  (* Since we have PARP inhibitors, we can infer defective homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e" for e <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, E), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, occurrence of DNA repair errors) *)
  (* Given defective homologous recombination repair, we can conclude DNA repair errors. *)
  then have "DNARepairErrors z" for z <ATP>
  (* We also have a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, preventing single strand break repair) *)
  (* Defective homologous recombination repair implies preventing single strand break repair. *)
  then have "PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z" for z <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, error-prone non-homologous end joining) *)
  (* Defective homologous recombination repair implies error-prone non-homologous end joining. *)
  then have "ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining y" for y <ATP>
  (* We need to find e, x, y such that the hypothesis holds. *)
