(* Explanation 1: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is a necessary condition for a patient to receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. RapidRecovery x ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling y ∧ NecessaryCondition z ∧ Patient e x ∧ ReceiveTreatment e ∧ With e z ∧ For e V600EMutation ∧ Vemurafenib x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e BetterResults ∧ Than e y VemurafenibMonotherapy"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by blast
  (* We know that rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is a necessary condition for a patient to receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), Not(B)), Implies(Not(Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling), Not(patient to receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation)) *)
  (* Since we do not have information about the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, we cannot infer the patient receiving treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot directly infer the yield, agent, patient, better results, and vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* Hence, the hypothesis cannot be proven with the given information. *)
