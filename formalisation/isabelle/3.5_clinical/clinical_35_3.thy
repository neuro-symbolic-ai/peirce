(* Explanation 1: There exists a specific Notch inhibitor that is effective in treating the given patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Specific x ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z ∧ GivenPatient y ∧ Activating z ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "GivenPatient y ∧ Activating z ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the given patient, activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from asm have "GivenPatient y ∧ Activating z ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that there exists a specific Notch inhibitor that is effective in treating the given patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* This implies that activating CTNNB1 mutations are related to being effective in treating the given patient. *)
  (* We can infer that a Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
