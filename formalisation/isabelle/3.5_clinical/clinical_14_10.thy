(* Explanation 1: The consequence being a result of the specific relationship implies the hypothesis about BRCA2 promoting the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y ∧ ResultOf y z ∧ SpecificRelationship z ∧ Implies z x ∧ Hypothesis x ∧ BRCA2Promoting e ∧ Agent e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ Joining e ∧ Patient e RepairMolecules ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ Humans RAD51Homolog1"

(* Explanation 2: The specific relationship between x and y, along with the consequence between x and y, leads to the inference that the consequence is a direct result of the specific relationship *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. SpecificRelationship x ∧ ResultOf x y ∧ Consequence x y ∧ LeadsTo z x ∧ Implies z x ∧ Hypothesis z ∧ DirectResult z ∧ DirectResultOf z x ∧ DirectResultOf z y"

(* Explanation 3: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y ∧ Implies z x ∧ BRCA2Promoting e ∧ Agent e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ Joining e ∧ Patient e RepairMolecules ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ Humans RAD51Homolog1"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Hypothesis x ∧ BRCA2Promoting e ∧ Agent e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ Joining e ∧ Patient e RepairMolecules ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ Humans RAD51Homolog1"
  (* Hypothesis: The specific relationship between x and y, along with the consequence between x and y, leads to the inference that the consequence is a direct result of the specific relationship *)
 shows "∃x y z e. SpecificRelationship x ∧ ResultOf x y ∧ Consequence x y ∧ LeadsTo z x ∧ Implies z x ∧ Hypothesis z ∧ DirectResult z ∧ DirectResultOf z x ∧ DirectResultOf z y"
