(* Explanation 1: The potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. CREBBP x ∧ Cancer y ∧ RoleIn x y ∧ LeadsTo z ∧ Directly z ∧ RelevanceOf NCT03568656 Patient ∧ ForPatient Patient"

(* Explanation 2: For a patient to be relevant, there must be a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Relevant x ⟶ (CausalLink y ∧ RoleIn CREBBP Cancer ∧ RelevanceOf NCT03568656 Patient)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ ForPatient x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about NCT03568656 and the patient. *)
  from asm have "NCT03568656 x" and "Patient y" <ATP>
  
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that the potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(potential role of CREBBP in cancer, causal link between A and B) *)
  (* We can infer a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  then have "CausalLink z ∧ RoleIn CREBBP Cancer ∧ RelevanceOf NCT03568656 Patient ∧ ForPatient Patient" for z <ATP>
  
  (* Since there is a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient, we can conclude that NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ ForPatient x" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
