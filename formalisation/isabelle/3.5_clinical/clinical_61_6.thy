(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is specifically involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (∃e. InvolvedIn e ∧ Repair e ∧ Via e HRR ∧ Break e ∧ DSB e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
 shows "∃e. InvolvedIn e ∧ Protein e x ∧ Repair e ∧ Via e HRR ∧ Break e ∧ DSB e ∧ HumanProtein x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that BRCA2 is specifically involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is involved in DSB DNA break repair and HRR. *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "∃e. InvolvedIn e ∧ Repair e ∧ Via e HRR ∧ Break e ∧ DSB e" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Since BRCA2 is involved in HRR, we can conclude that it is a human protein. *)
  then have "∃e. InvolvedIn e ∧ Protein e x ∧ Repair e ∧ Via e HRR ∧ Break e ∧ DSB e ∧ HumanProtein x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
