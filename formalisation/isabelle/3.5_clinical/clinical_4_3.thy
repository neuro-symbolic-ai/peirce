(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies that it can cause chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ HumanProtein e ⟶ Cause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HumanProtein x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that HumanProtein x. *)
  from asm have "HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein, it can cause chromosome breakage). *)
  (* We can infer that LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage from the premise. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ Patient e ChromosomeBreakage" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
