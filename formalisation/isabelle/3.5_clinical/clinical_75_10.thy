(* Explanation 1: Specify that PIK3Ca x being an activating mutation implies it is an activating mutation in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. ActivatingMutation x ⟶ ActivatingMutationInBreastCancer x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3Ca x is true. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), which states that if PIK3Ca is an activating mutation, then it is an activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  (* Since PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation, we can infer that it is also an activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation x" sledgehammer
  (* Since PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation in breast cancer, we can conclude that it is associated with breast cancer. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
