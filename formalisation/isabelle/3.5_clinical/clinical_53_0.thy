(* Explanation 1: Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossOfPALB2 e ∧ Prevent e ∧ (∃e1. ActionOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ Joining e1 ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e1 ∧ In e1 HRR)"

(* Explanation 2: In the absence of functional HRR genes, DNA repair defaults to NHEJ *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e. AbsenceOfFunctionalHRRGenes e ∧ DefaultTo e NHEJ ∧ DNARepair e"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to NHEJ repair processes *)
  shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ DefaultTo e NHEJ"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e" <ATP>
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(Loss of PALB2, Not(action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR)) *)
  (* Since Loss of BRCA2 is not mentioned in the explanation, we cannot directly infer the default repair process. *)
  (* We need to consider the other explanation that in the absence of functional HRR genes, DNA repair defaults to NHEJ. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(absence of functional HRR genes, DNA repair defaults to NHEJ) *)
  (* We can use this to infer that Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to NHEJ repair processes. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain e where "AbsenceOfFunctionalHRRGenes e ∧ DefaultTo e NHEJ ∧ DNARepair e" by auto
  then have "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ DefaultTo e NHEJ" by auto
  then show ?thesis by auto
