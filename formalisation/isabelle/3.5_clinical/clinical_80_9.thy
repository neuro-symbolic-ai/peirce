(* Explanation 1: If a patient has TNBC, then the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Patient x ∧ TNBC y ⟶ NotAppropriateFor e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ TNBC y ∧ NotAppropriateFor e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ SecondLineTherapy e"

proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC y" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states if a patient has TNBC, then the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* We can derive the logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(a patient has TNBC, Not(the patient is appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors)) *)
  (* Since the patient has TNBC, we can infer that the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "NotAppropriateFor e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors e" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis states that the patient with TNBC is not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy. *)
  (* We need to show that the patient with TNBC is not appropriate for second line therapy. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient is not appropriate for second line therapy from the previous inference. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ TNBC y ∧ NotAppropriateFor e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ SecondLineTherapy e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
