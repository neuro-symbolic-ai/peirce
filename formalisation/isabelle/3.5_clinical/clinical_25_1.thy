(* Explanation 1: YAP suppression leads to the inhibition of β-catenin activity, suggesting a potential relationship between YAP suppression and the effectiveness of a YAP inhibitor in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. YAPSuppression x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ YAPInhibitor z ⟶ (Leads e ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e (theInhibitionOf y) ∧ Relationship e ∧ Between e x z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x y. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ⟶ (Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about YAPInhibitor x and βCateninActivity y. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(YAP suppression, inhibition of β-catenin activity) *)
  (* We can infer inhibition of β-catenin activity from YAP suppression. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(inhibition of β-catenin activity, effectiveness of a YAP inhibitor in inhibiting β-catenin activity) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that a YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  then have "Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
