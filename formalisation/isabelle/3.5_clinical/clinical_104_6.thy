(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Located x intracellular kinaseDomain ∧ Contribute e1 ∧ Patient e1 trastuzumabResistance ∧ Not(Contribute e2) ∧ Patient e2 trastuzumabResistance ∧ BindsTo trastuzumab extracellular kinaseDomain"

(* Explanation 2: The resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Resistance x ∧ InducedBy x HER2 HER2 activatingMutation ∧ Not(Related e1) ∧ Patient e1 HER2V777L ∧ Related e2 ∧ Patient e2 HER2V777L"

(* Explanation 3: There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Mechanism x ∧ Specific x ∧ Identify e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Through x HER2V777L ∧ LeadTo e treatmentResistance trastuzumab"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Targeting(x, HER2V777L, y) ∧ Inhibitor(y) ∧ Irreversible(y) ∧ TyrosineKinase(y)"
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting x HER2V777L y ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ Irreversible y ∧ TyrosineKinase y ∧ Overcome e ∧ Patient e trastuzumabResistance"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about targeting, inhibitor, irreversible, and tyrosine kinase. *)
  from asm have "Targeting(x, HER2V777L, y)" and "Inhibitor(y)" and "Irreversible(y)" and "TyrosineKinase(y)" <ATP>
  (* There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  (* This implies that the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  from explanation_3 have "Mechanism x ∧ Specific x ∧ Identify e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Through x HER2V777L ∧ LeadTo e treatmentResistance trastuzumab" <ATP>
  then have "HER2V777L x" <ATP>
  (* The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  (* This implies that the HER2 V777L mutation does not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  from explanation_1 have "HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Located x intracellular kinaseDomain ∧ Contribute e1 ∧ Patient e1 trastuzumabResistance ∧ Not(Contribute e2) ∧ Patient e2 trastuzumabResistance ∧ BindsTo trastuzumab extracellular kinaseDomain" <ATP>
  then have "Not(HER2V777L x)" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above two inferences, we can conclude that the HER2 V777L mutation does not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance but could lead to treatment resistance. *)
  then have "HER2V777L x ∧ Not(HER2V777L x)" <ATP>
  (* This leads to a contradiction, which allows us to derive the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
