(* Explanation 1: The potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. CREBBP x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Role z ∧ In x z ∧ LeadsTo z ∧ RelevanceOf x NCT03568656"

(* Explanation 2: For a patient to be relevant, there must be a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ LeadsTo z ⟶ (CausalLink CREBBP Cancer ∧ CausalLink NCT03568656 Patient)"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ RelevanceOf x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the known information about NCT03568656 and the patient. *)
  from asm have "NCT03568656 x" and "Patient y" <ATP>
  (* The relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient is related to the potential role of CREBBP in cancer. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(potential role of CREBBP in cancer, causal link between A and B) *)
  (* Both A and D are from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We have NCT03568656 x, so we can infer the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  then have "NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ RelevanceOf x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
