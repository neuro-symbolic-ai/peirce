(* Explanation 1: A patient who is less sensitive to chemotherapy is more likely to have previously received endocrine therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ LessSensitiveToChemotherapy x ∧ MoreLikely e ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x"

(* Explanation 2: Patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x ⟶ MoreLikely e ∧ Exhibit e ∧ ReducedSensitivityToChemotherapy x"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x"
 (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation *)
 shows "BenefitFrom e ∧ Treatment e AlpelisibFulvestrant ∧ Target e PIK3CA_mutation"
  sledgehammer
