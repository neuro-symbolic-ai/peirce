(* Explanation 1: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BRAF x ∧ (MAPK/ERK) y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ ThroughRegulationOf x y"

(* Explanation 2: A BRAF mutation is a spontaneous change in the BRAF gene that causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. BRAFMutation x ∧ BRAFGene y ∧ Protein z ∧ SpontaneousChange e1 ∧ Causes e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ TurnOn e2 ∧ KeepOn e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "MutationInBRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
  shows "∃x y e. MutationInBRAF x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ∧ Affects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about MutationInBRAF x. *)
  from asm have "MutationInBRAF x" <ATP>
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that a BRAF mutation causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRAF mutation occurs, BRAF mutation causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on) *)
  (* Since we have MutationInBRAF x, we can infer that it affects the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
  then have "∃y z e1 e2. BRAFGene y ∧ Protein z ∧ TurnOn e1 ∧ KeepOn e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 1 states that through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* We can infer that if the gene turns on the protein and keeps it on, it affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "∃y z e1 e2. CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ∧ Affects e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
