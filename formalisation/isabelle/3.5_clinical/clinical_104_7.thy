(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ LocatedIn x IntracellularKinaseDomain ∧ NotDirectlyContribute e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e TrastuzumabResistance ∧ BindsTo y ExtracellularKinaseDomain ∧ As x y"

(* Explanation 2: The resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. ResistanceInducedBy x ∧ HER2ActivatingMutation x ∧ NotDirectlyRelated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e HER2_V777L_Mutation"

(* Explanation 3: There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Need x ∧ Identify y ∧ SpecificMechanism z ∧ LeadTo e ∧ Agent e HER2_V777L_Mutation ∧ Patient e TreatmentResistance ∧ ToIdentify x z ∧ ThroughWhich z y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting x y ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation y ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor z ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e TreatmentResistance"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the HER2 V777L mutation and the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "HER2_V777L_Mutation x" and "IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer that the HER2 V777L mutation may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  then have "NotDirectlyContribute e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain) *)
  (* We can infer that trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
  then have "BindsTo y ExtracellularKinaseDomain" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain) *)
  (* We can conclude that the HER2 V777L mutation is related to trastuzumab binding to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
  then have "As x y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, G), Implies(may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation, HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can deduce that the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  then have "HER2_V777L_Mutation y ∧ TreatmentResistance" <ATP>
  (* We have the necessary elements to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
