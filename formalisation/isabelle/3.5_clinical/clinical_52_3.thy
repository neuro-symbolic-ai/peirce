(* Explanation 1: PARP1 recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y. PARP1 x ∧ RepairProteins y ∧ SitesOfDNA x ∧ Damage y ∧ Recruits e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
 shows "∃e x. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvedIn e x ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ DNA e ∧ SSDNARepair e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP1 x. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" by simp
  (* From the explanation sentence, we have PARP1 x recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that PARP1 x is involved in repair and recognition of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  then have "∃e x. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvedIn e x ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ DNA e ∧ SSDNARepair e" sledgehammer
