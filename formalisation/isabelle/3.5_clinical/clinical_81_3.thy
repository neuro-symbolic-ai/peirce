(* Explanation 1: If a patient has TNBC, they are considered for specific treatments tailored for TNBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ⟶ (Considered e ∧ For e SpecificTreatmentsTailoredForTNBC)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient is considered for specific treatments tailored for TNBC, then they are considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Considered e1 ∧ For e1 SpecificTreatmentsTailoredForTNBC ⟶ (Considered e2 ∧ For e2 SecondLineTreatment)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Considered e ∧ For e SecondLineTreatment"
