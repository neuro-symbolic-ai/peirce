(* Explanation 1: An activating mutation in CTNNB1 is present in the patient with hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where

axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(activating mutation in CTNNB1 is present in the patient with hepatoblastoma, patient with hepatoblastoma has an activating mutation in CTNNB) *)
  (* We can use the Equivalent relation to infer the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
