(* Explanation 1: The patient having the BRAF V600E mutation implies that the patient has the most common BRAF mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation x BRAFV600E ⟶ (∃y. Mutation y BRAF ∧ Common y)"

(* Explanation 2: The most common BRAF mutation results in constitutive hyperactivation and oncogenic transformation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Mutation x BRAF ∧ Common x ⟶ Hyperactivation x ∧ Transformation x"

(* Explanation 3: The patient having the most common BRAF mutation implies that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation x BRAF ∧ Common BRAF ⟶ Mutation y BRAFV600E ∧ Common y"

axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient(x)"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has common BRAF V600E mutation *)
  shows "∃x. Patient(x) ∧ Mutation(x, BRAF V600E)"
