(* Explanation 1: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. KinaseInhibitor e ⟶ Target e (Mutations PI3K_AKT_pathway) ∧ Inhibit e Proliferation ∧ Inhibit e Survival"

(* Explanation 2: Treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ PIK3CA_mutated x ∧ HR_positive x ∧ HER2_negative x ∧ AdvancedBreastCancer x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x ⟶ Prolonged e ProgressionFreeSurvival"

(* Explanation 3: A patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Patient x ⟶ LessSensitive x Chemotherapy"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
 shows "∃e. BenefitFromTreatment e ∧ Target e (PIK3CA mutation)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has received endocrine therapy e. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously, patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient who received endocrine therapy is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ LessSensitive x Chemotherapy" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), Implies(Not(patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy), Not(using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival)) *)
  (* Since the patient is less sensitive to chemotherapy, we can infer that using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
  then have "Target e (Mutations PI3K_AKT_pathway) ∧ Inhibit e Proliferation ∧ Inhibit e Survival" for e <ATP>
  (* We know that the treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant is beneficial for patients with PIK3CA mutation. *)
  then have "BenefitFromTreatment e ∧ Target e (Mutations PI3K_AKT_pathway)" for e <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
