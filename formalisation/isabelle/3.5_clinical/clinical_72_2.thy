(* Explanation 1: If a subunit is catalytic, then the transcription of p110α is related to it *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Subunit x ∧ Catalytic x ⟶ (TranscriptionOfP110Alpha y ∧ RelatedTo y x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PI3KsCatalyticSubunitP110 x ∧ PIK3CAGene z"
 (* Hypothesis: PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110, of which p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene *)
 shows "∃x y z. PI3KsCatalyticSubunitP110 x ∧ PIK3CAGene z ∧ TranscribedFrom y z ∧ IsTranscribedFrom x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110 and PIK3CA gene. *)
  from asm have "PI3KsCatalyticSubunitP110 x" and "PIK3CAGene z" apply simp
  (* We have the logical proposition Implies(A, B), Implies(a subunit is catalytic, the transcription of p110α is related to it). *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentence to infer the relationship between PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110 and the transcription of p110α. *)
  (* Since PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110 is related to the transcription of p110α, we can derive the existence of the transcription. *)
  then have "∃y. TranscriptionOfP110Alpha y ∧ RelatedTo y x" by (simp add: assms)
  (* We can further infer that the transcription is from the PIK3CA gene. *)
  then obtain y where "TranscriptionOfP110Alpha y ∧ RelatedTo y x" by auto
  then have "TranscribedFrom y z" and "IsTranscribedFrom x y" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we have shown the existence of x, y, and z satisfying the required conditions. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
