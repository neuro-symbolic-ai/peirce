(* Explanation 1: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x"

(* Explanation 2: The best response of first-line therapy was stable disease *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Therapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Disease z ∧ Stable z ∧ Was e ∧ Origin e y ∧ Of e x ∧ Of e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x ∧ After e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by blast
  (* We have the logical proposition A: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient has received first-line chemotherapy, the best response of first-line therapy was stable disease) *)
  (* We can infer the best response was stable disease. *)
  then have "Disease y ∧ Stable y" for y using explanation_2 by blast
  (* We also have the information about Treatment and Chemotherapy. *)
  then obtain z where "Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* We can construct the final conclusion based on the given information. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
