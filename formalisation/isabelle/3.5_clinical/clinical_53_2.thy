(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 leads to a disruption in the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y z. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Disruption x ∧ ActionOfBRCA2 z ∧ JoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules y ∧ InHRR y ∧ Leads e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ Agent e z"

(* Explanation 2: In the scenario where BRCA2 is not functional, the cell defaults to NHEJ repair processes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Cell x ∧ DefaultToNHEJRepairProcesses y ∧ NotFunctional BRCA2 ⟶ Defaults x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cell y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to NHEJ repair processes *)
 shows "∃e x y. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cell y ∧ DefaultToNHEJRepairProcesses x ∧ Causes e y x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a loss of BRCA2 and a cell is involved. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e" and "Cell y" apply simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 leads to a disruption in the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2, disruption in the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR) *)
  (* We can infer that the disruption in the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR has occurred. *)
  then have "Disruption x ∧ ActionOfBRCA2 z ∧ JoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules y ∧ InHRR y ∧ Leads e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ Agent e z" by (simp add: assms)
  (* We also have an explanatory sentence that in the scenario where BRCA2 is not functional, the cell defaults to NHEJ repair processes. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(BRCA2 is not functional, cell defaults to NHEJ repair processes) *)
  (* Since BRCA2 is not functional, the cell defaults to NHEJ repair processes. *)
  then have "DefaultToNHEJRepairProcesses x" sledgehammer
  (* We can conclude that the loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to NHEJ repair processes. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
