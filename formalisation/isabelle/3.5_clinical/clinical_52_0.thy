(* Explanation 1: PARP1 synthesis PAR which recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ PAR y ∧ Protein z ∧ RepairProteins e z ∧ SitesOfDNADamage e ∧ Synthesis e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e y ∧ Recruits e z y"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. PARP1 x ∧ SitesOfSSDNADamage e ∧ Detects e ∧ Binds e ∧ Agent x e"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
  shows "∃e x. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvedIn e x ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ DNADamage e ∧ In e SS ∧ SSRepair e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP1 x. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), which states that if PARP1 synthesis PAR which recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage, then PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage. *)
  (* We can use the information from explanatory sentence 1 to infer that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  (* Since PARP1 synthesis PAR which recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage, and PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, we can conclude that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  then have "∃e x. PARP1 x ∧ InvolvedIn e x ∧ Recognition e ∧ Repair e ∧ DNADamage e ∧ In e SS ∧ SSRepair e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
