(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations if and only if it inhibits β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. (Inhibit e ∧ βCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Activating e CTNNB1) ⟷ (Inhibit e ∧ βCatenin e)"

(* Explanation 2: If inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, then it inhibits β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. (Inhibit e ∧ βCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Activating e CTNNB1 ⟶ Inhibit e ∧ βCatenin e)"

(* Explanation 3: If inhibiting β-catenin, then it is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient e x ∧ Activating e CTNNB1"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃e. Inhibit e ∧ βCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Activating e CTNNB1"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient and the activation of CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient e x ∧ Activating e CTNNB1" by auto
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(Inhibiting β-catenin, Inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations) *)
  (* We can infer that if inhibiting β-catenin, then it is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from asm and explanation_3 have "Effective e ∧ Treat e" sledgehammer
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, Inhibiting β-catenin) *)
  (* Since inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, it also inhibits β-catenin. *)
  from asm and explanation_1 have "Inhibit e ∧ βCatenin e" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above inferences, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
