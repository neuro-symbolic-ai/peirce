(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. BRAF e ∧ ProtoOncogene e ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK"

(* Explanation 2: The MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. MAPK_ERK e ∧ Affect e CellDivision ∧ Affect e Differentiation ∧ Affect e Secretion"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
 shows "∃e. BRAF x ∧ Role e ∧ In e CellDivision ∧ In e Differentiation ∧ In e Secretion ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRAF is a proto-oncogene, BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since we have BRAF x, we can infer that BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "BRAF x ∧ ProtoOncogene x ∧ Regulate x MAPK_ERK" <ATP>
  (* We have another logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion) *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 1, C is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since we have BRAF x playing important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, we can infer that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "BRAF x ∧ ProtoOncogene x ∧ Regulate x MAPK_ERK ∧ MAPK_ERK x ∧ Affect x CellDivision ∧ Affect x Differentiation ∧ Affect x Secretion" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the information to form the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
