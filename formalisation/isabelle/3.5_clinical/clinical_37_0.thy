(* Explanation 1: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257study is only in Canada *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CFI_402257study x ∧ In x Canada"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Travel e ∧ HaveTo e ∧ MayNotBeSuitable e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we have CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient. *)
  (* This implies that there exists a y such that CFI-402257 x and SuitableFor x y. *)
  obtain y where "CFI_402257 x ∧ SuitableFor x y" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* Since CFI-402257study is only in Canada, and CFI-402257 x, we can infer that CFI-402257 x is in Canada. *)
  from explanation_2 have "In x Canada" if "CFI_402257study x" by auto
  (* Therefore, the patient will have to travel, may not be suitable. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Travel x ∧ HaveTo x ∧ MayNotBeSuitable x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
