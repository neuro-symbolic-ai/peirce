(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if x is a PARP inhibitor and x targets tumor-specific defects in DNA repair, then x is used for the treatment of the patient y with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative, AdvancedOrMetastaticBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (PARPInhibitor x ∧ Targets x (TumorSpecificDefectsInDNARepair x)) ⟶ TreatmentFor x (BRCA y) (HER y) (AdvancedOrMetastaticBC y)"

(* Explanation 2: The treatment administered to the patient y with specific characteristics includes the PARP inhibitors Olaparib and Talazoparib *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃y. Patient y ∧ SpecificCharacteristics y ∧ (TreatmentFor Olaparib (BRCA y) (HER y) (AdvancedOrMetastaticBC y)) ∧ (TreatmentFor Talazoparib (BRCA y) (HER y) (AdvancedOrMetastaticBC y))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib x"
  (* Hypothesis: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC *)
 shows "PARPInhibitor x ∧ TreatmentFor x (BRCA x) (HER x) (AdvancedOrMetastaticBC x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Olaparib and Talazoparib are PARP inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitor x" <ATP>
  (* We also know that the treatment administered includes Olaparib and Talazoparib for patients with specific characteristics. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, C), Implies(The treatment administered includes the PARP inhibitors Olaparib and Talazoparib, x is used for the treatment of the patient y with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC) *)
  (* Since Olaparib and Talazoparib are used for the treatment, we can infer that they are used for patients with specific characteristics. *)
  then have "TreatmentFor x (BRCA x) (HER x) (AdvancedOrMetastaticBC x)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
