(* Explanation 1: If PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for a patient, then the patient is also not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. PARPInhibitors x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ Patient z ⟶ (NotAppropriate z ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y)"

(* Explanation 2: If PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for a patient, then the patient is also not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. PARPInhibitors x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ Patient z ⟶ (NotAppropriate z ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ SecondLineTherapy y ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x and has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by blast
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(Not(A), Not(B)), which means if PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for a patient, then the patient is also not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* We can apply this relation to the patient x. *)
  (* Since the patient x has TNBC, we can infer that PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for the patient x. *)
  (* Therefore, the patient x is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "NotAppropriate x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show the existence of x and y such that the patient x with TNBC is not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy. *)
  (* We can choose y as SecondLineTherapy since the patient is not appropriate for PARP inhibitors. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ NotAppropriate x ∧ SecondLineTherapy x ∧ (Immunotherapy x ∨ PARPInhibitors x)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
