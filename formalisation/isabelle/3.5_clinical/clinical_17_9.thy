(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. TumorSuppressor BRCA2 ⟶ HumanProtein BRCA2"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 protein. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, BRCA2 protein is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 protein) *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer that it is a human protein specifically in the context of BRCA2 protein. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* We need to show that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* There is no direct information or logical relation provided to infer this. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot deduce InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair from the given premise and explanations. *)
  (* Hence, we cannot prove the full hypothesis based on the available information. *)
