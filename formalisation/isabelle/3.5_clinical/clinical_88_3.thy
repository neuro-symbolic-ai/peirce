(* Explanation 1: If a patient does not have a BRCA mutation, then PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ BRCA_Mutation y ∧ ¬(Have x y) ⟶ (∀e. PARPInhibitors e ∧ Patient z ∧ NotAppropriate e z)"

(* Explanation 2: The absence of a BRCA mutation in a patient implies that Olaparib and talazoparib are not suitable for the treatment of that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. BRCA_Mutation x ∧ Patient y ∧ Absence x y ⟶ (∀e. Olaparib e ∧ Talazoparib e ∧ Patient z ∧ NotSuitable e z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors not appropriate for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotAppropriate x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(Not(A), Not(B)), which means if a patient does not have a BRCA mutation, then PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for that patient. *)
  (* Since we have Patient x, we can infer that the patient does not have a BRCA mutation. *)
  (* Therefore, PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Patient x› have "∀e. PARPInhibitors e ∧ Patient x ∧ NotAppropriate e x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
