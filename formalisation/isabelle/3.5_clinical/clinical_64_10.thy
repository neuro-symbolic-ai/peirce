(* Explanation 1: A patient who is less sensitive to chemotherapy is more likely to have previously received endocrine therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ LessSensitive e1 ∧ Chemotherapy e1 ∧ MoreLikely e2 ∧ Received x e2 ∧ EndocrineTherapy e2"

(* Explanation 2: Patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e1 e2. Patients x ∧ Received x e1 ∧ EndocrineTherapy e1 ∧ MoreLikely e2 ∧ Exhibit e2 ∧ ReducedSensitivity e2 ∧ Chemotherapy e2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy e1"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation *)
 shows "∃x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy e1 ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ Treatment e2 ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant e2 ∧ Target e2 PIK3CA ∧ Received x e1 ∧ Agent e1 x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has received endocrine therapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy e1" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, D), which states that if a patient has received endocrine therapy, they exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  (* Since the patient has received endocrine therapy, we can infer that they exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ReducedSensitivity e2 ∧ Chemotherapy e2" for e2 using explanation_2 by blast
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have the information that patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient x exhibits reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ReducedSensitivity e2" for e2 by simp
  (* The hypothesis states that if a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient x benefits from the treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ Treatment e2 ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant e2 ∧ Target e2 PIK3CA" for e2 sledgehammer
  (* Finally, we know that the patient x has received endocrine therapy. *)
  then have "Received x e1 ∧ Agent e1 x" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude that there exists x, e1, and e2 such that the patient x benefits from the treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
