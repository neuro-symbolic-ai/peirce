(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x HomologousRecombinationRepair"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ WhereinReplacedBy x DamagedDNA UndamagedHomologousMolecules SisterChromatids PaternalCopies MaternalCopies"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA break repair via homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x HomologousRecombinationRepair ∧ RepairVia x HomologousRecombinationRepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x HomologousRecombinationRepair" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* Both A and C are from explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that BRCA2 is involved in repairing DNA via homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x x HomologousRecombinationRepair ∧ RepairVia x HomologousRecombinationRepair" <ATP>
