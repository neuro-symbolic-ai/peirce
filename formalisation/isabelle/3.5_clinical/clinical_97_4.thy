(* Explanation 1: The patient having the BRAF V600E mutation implies that the patient has the most common BRAF mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x BRAF_V600E ⟶ HasMutation x MostCommonBRAF"

(* Explanation 2: The most common BRAF mutation results in constitutive hyperactivation and oncogenic transformation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HasMutation x MostCommonBRAF ⟶ (Hyperactivation e1 ∧ Transformation e2)"

(* Explanation 3: The patient having the most common BRAF mutation implies that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. HasMutation x MostCommonBRAF ⟶ HasMutation x CommonBRAF_V600E"

(* Explanation 4: The patient having the BRAF V600E mutation implies that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. HasMutation x BRAF_V600E ⟶ HasMutation x CommonBRAF_V600E"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has common BRAF V600E mutation *)
 shows "∃x. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x BRAF_V600E"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has the BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ HasMutation x BRAF_V600E" sledgehammer
  (* There are several implications that can help us infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Implication: Implies(A, B), Implies(patient having the BRAF V600E mutation, patient has the most common BRAF mutation) *)
  (* Implication: Implies(B, D), Implies(patient has the most common BRAF mutation, patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation) *)
  (* Using the above implications, we can conclude that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  then have "∃x. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x CommonBRAF_V600E" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
