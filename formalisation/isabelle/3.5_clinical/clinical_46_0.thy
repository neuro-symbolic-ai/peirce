(* Explanation 1: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs by preventing SS break repair, relying on defective HRR and error prone NHEJ to repair DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociated y ∧ DSBs z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Prevent e1 z ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ RelyOn e2 x ∧ DefectiveHRR e2 ∧ ErrorProneNHEJ e2 ∧ Repair e2 z"

(* Explanation 2: Synthetic lethality is when co-occurrence of multiple genetic events results in cell death *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. SyntheticLethality x ∧ CoOccurrence y ∧ MultipleGeneticEvents y ∧ Result y CellDeath"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossOfPALB2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of PALB2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossOfPALB2 x ∧ PARP1Inhibition y ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ RelyOn e z ∧ Repair e DNA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about patients and the loss of PALB2. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossOfPALB2 x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, G), Implies(synthetic lethality, co-occurrence of multiple genetic events) *)
  (* We can infer that if there is synthetic lethality, there is a co-occurrence of multiple genetic events. *)
  (* Since we have LossOfPALB2 x, we can conclude that there is a co-occurrence of multiple genetic events. *)
  then have "CoOccurrence y" for y <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(G, F), Implies(co-occurrence of multiple genetic events, synthetic lethality) *)
  (* Given the co-occurrence of multiple genetic events, we can deduce synthetic lethality. *)
  then have "SyntheticLethality z" for z <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, H), Implies(synthetic lethality, result in cell death) *)
  (* With synthetic lethality, we can derive that it results in cell death. *)
  then have "Result z CellDeath" for z <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 1, we have PARP inhibitors causing replication-associated DSBs and relying on error-prone NHEJ to repair DNA. *)
  (* This implies that PARP inhibitors cause replication-associated DSBs and repair DNA. *)
  then have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ Repair e DNA" for x e <ATP>
  (* Since we have PARP inhibitors, we can conclude that there is a cause event. *)
  then have "Cause e" for e <ATP>
  (* We also know that the agent of the cause event is z, the patient is x, and the patient relies on z. *)
  then have "Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ RelyOn e z" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can derive the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
