(* Explanation 1: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ Mutated x V777L HER2 ∧ Amplified x HER2 ∧ BreastCancer x"

(* Explanation 2: Adding an explanatory sentence that explicitly states the direct causation relationship *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ Mutation e ∧ Agent e x ∧ DirectCause e ∧ Amplification e ∧ Patient x"

(* Explanation 3: Emphasizing the direct causal link between the mutation V777L in HER2 and the amplification of HER2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ Mutation e ∧ Agent e x ∧ DirectCause e ∧ Amplification e ∧ Patient x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x. Patient x ∧ Mutated x V777L HER2 ∧ Amplified x HER2 ∧ BreastCancer x"
