(* Explanation 1: PARP2 encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 2 protein, which contains a catalytic domain *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. PARP2 x ∧ PolyADPRibosylTransferase y ∧ Encodes e x y ∧ Contains y (CatalyticDomain y)"

(* Explanation 2: Capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. CapableOf e x y ∧ PolyADPRibosylationReaction y"

(* Explanation 3: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferse which, via polyADP-riosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. PARP1 x ∧ PolyADPRibosylTransferse y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Modifies e x z ∧ NuclearProteins z ∧ ImportantFor z CellularProcesses ∧ ImportantFor z RecoveryFromDNADamage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e. InvolvedIn e x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation e ∧ ImportantFor e RecoveryFromDNADamage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP1 x and PARP2 x. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" and "PARP2 x" <ATP>
  (* PARP1 is related to logical proposition D, and PARP2 is related to logical propositions A, B, and C. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferase, PARP1 modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage) *)
  (* There are logical relations Implies(A, B), Implies(B, C), and Implies(A, C) *)
  (* We can infer that PARP1 modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "PARP1 modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage" <ATP>
  (* Since PARP1 is involved in the process, we can conclude that it is involved in polyADP-ribosylation and important for recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
