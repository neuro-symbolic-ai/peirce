(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, then they are considered to have an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 2: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, then they are considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation x CTNNB1  ⟶ In x CTNNB1Pathway"

(* Explanation 3: If a patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway and drugs targeting the Wnt pathway are effective, then those drugs may be effective in the patient *)
axiomatization where

axiomatization where

(* Explanation 5: If a patient is a patient and has an activating mutation, then they are considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB *)

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Drugs y ∧ Targeting y WntPathway ∧ EffectiveIn y x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, E), Implies(a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, a patient is considered to be a patient) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient x is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB from the premise. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation x CTNNB1" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, A), Implies(a patient is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB, a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1) *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient x has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "PatientWithActivatingMutation x CTNNB1" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, E), Implies(a patient is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB, a patient is considered to be a patient) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient x is considered to be a patient. *)
  then have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, C), Implies(a patient is considered to be a patient, a patient is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway) *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient x is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  then have "In x CTNNB1Pathway" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C and D, E), Implies(drugs targeting the Wnt pathway are effective in the patient, a patient is considered to be a patient) *)
  (* Since the drugs targeting the Wnt pathway are effective in the patient x, we can infer that the drugs may be effective in the patient x. *)
  then have "∃y. Drugs y ∧ Targeting y WntPathway ∧ EffectiveIn y x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
