(* Explanation 1: PD-1/PD-L1 drugs, specifically PD1PDL1Drugs, have shown promising outcomes in TNBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. PD1PDL1Drugs x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ In x y ∧ TNBC y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PD1PDL1Drugs x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC *)
 shows "∃x y. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ In x y ∧ TNBC y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about PD-1/PD-L1 drugs and promising outcomes. *)
  from asm have "PD1PDL1Drugs x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that PD-1/PD-L1 drugs have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* We can infer that PD-1/PD-L1 drugs are related to TNBC. *)
  (* Since the relationship between PD-1/PD-L1 drugs and TNBC is established, we can introduce a new concept, ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  then have "∃x y. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ In x y ∧ TNBC y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
