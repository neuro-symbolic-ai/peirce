(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 is equivalent to BRCA2 not being functional *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. LossOfBRCA2 x ⟶ ¬Functional BRCA2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y"
 (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to NHEJ repair processes *)
 shows "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ⟶ (DefaultToNHEJRepair e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the loss of BRCA2 and the cell. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x" and "Cell y" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2, BRCA2 not being functional) *)
  (* We can infer that if there is a loss of BRCA2, then BRCA2 is not functional. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹LossOfBRCA2 x› have "¬Functional BRCA2" by (simp add: assms)
  (* Since BRCA2 is not functional, it implies the loss of BRCA2. *)
  then have "LossOfBRCA2 x" by simp
  (* We have the necessary conditions for the hypothesis. *)
