(* Explanation 1: If there is an absence of SS breaks, then there is an absence of HRR activation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. AbsenceOfSSBreaks e ⟶ AbsenceOfHRRAcivation e"

(* Explanation 2: The absence of SS breaks and the absence of HRR activation imply the inhibition of PARP, resulting in collapsed replication forks and DSB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. (AbsenceOfSSBreaks e ∧ AbsenceOfHRRAcivation e) ⟶ (InhibitionOfPARP e ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DSB e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP e"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB *)
 shows "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DSB e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the inhibition of PARP. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP e" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, And(D, E)), Implies(inhibition of PARP, collapsed replication forks and DSB) *)
  (* We can infer that inhibition of PARP leads to collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
  then have "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DSB e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
