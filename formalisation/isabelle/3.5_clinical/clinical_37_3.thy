(* Explanation 1: If CFI-402257 is not suitable for a patient, then the patient will have to travel and may not be suitable *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor z y x ⟶ (Travel e1 ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬Suitable e2)"

(* Explanation 2: If the patient will have to travel, then the treatment may not be suitable *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ⟶ (Treatment y ∧ ¬Suitable e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor z y x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
 shows "∃x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ∧ Suitable e2 ∧ ¬Suitable e2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about CFI-402257, patient, and suitability. *)
  from asm have "CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor z y x" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), Or(B, Not(C))), Implies(Not(CFI-402257 is suitable for a patient), B | ~C) *)
  (* We have Not(A), so we can infer B or Not(C). *)
  (* Since we have Patient y, we can infer the patient will have to travel. *)
  then have "Patient y ∧ Travel e1" for e1 using explanation_1 by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, Not(C)), Implies(the patient will have to travel, Not(the treatment is suitable)) *)
  (* We have B, so we can infer Not(C). *)
  (* Since we have Patient y, we can infer Not(Suitable e2). *)
  then have "Patient y ∧ ¬Suitable e2" for e2 using explanation_2 by blast
  (* We also know that Suitable e2 from the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ∧ Suitable e2 ∧ ¬Suitable e2" sledgehammer
