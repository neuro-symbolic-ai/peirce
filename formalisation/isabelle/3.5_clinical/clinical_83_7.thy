(* Explanation 1: If a patient receives vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment, then the treatment is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment e ∧ Receives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Patient z ⟶ SpecificallyIdentifiedAsFirstLineChemotherapy e"

(* Explanation 2: First-line chemotherapy is the initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. FirstLineChemotherapy x ∧ InitialChemotherapyTreatment y ∧ Patient z ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient x ∧ ForCondition e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Receives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has received first-line chemotherapy y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(first-line chemotherapy is the initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition, treatment is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that the first-line chemotherapy y is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "SpecificallyIdentifiedAsFirstLineChemotherapy e" for e sledgehammer
  (* Since the patient x has received first-line chemotherapy y and it is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy, we can infer that the patient x has received the treatment. *)
  then have "Receives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y" for e y <ATP>
  then show ?thesis by <ATP>
