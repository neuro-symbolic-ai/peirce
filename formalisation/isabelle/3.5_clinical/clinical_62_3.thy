(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 being a human gene implies that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 being a human gene implies that the protein associated with BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (ProteinAssociated x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x)"

(* Explanation 3: If BRCA2 is a human gene, then the protein associated with BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (ProteinAssociated x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x"
  using assms explanation_1 explanation_2 by blast
