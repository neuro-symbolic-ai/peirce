(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is a human protein and involved in HRR. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
