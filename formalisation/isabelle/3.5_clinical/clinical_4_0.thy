(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomeStability"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e"
 (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e" by simp
  (* From the explanation sentence, we can infer that BRCA2 is a human protein. *)
  have "BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x" for x using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Since loss of BRCA2 is the premise, and BRCA2 is a human protein, we can infer that loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
