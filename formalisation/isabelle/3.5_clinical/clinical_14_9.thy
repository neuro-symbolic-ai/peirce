(* Explanation 1: The consequence being a result of the specific relationship implies the hypothesis about BRCA2 promoting the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y ∧ ResultOf y z ∧ SpecificRelationship z ⟶ (Hypothesis x ∧ BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Humans z)"

(* Explanation 2: The specific relationship between x and y, along with the consequence between x and y, leads to the inference that the consequence is a direct result of the specific relationship *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. SpecificRelationship x y ∧ Consequence x z ⟶ (Inference z ∧ DirectResult z)"

(* Explanation 3: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y ∧ InferredFrom y z ⟶ (BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Joining e ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Humans z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Hypothesis x ∧ BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Humans z"
  (* Hypothesis: The specific relationship between x and y, along with the consequence between x and y, leads to the inference that the consequence is a direct result of the specific relationship *)
  shows "∀x y z. SpecificRelationship x y ∧ Consequence x z ⟶ (Inference z ∧ DirectResult z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the hypothesis, including BRCA2, repair molecules, undamaged molecules, homologous molecules, joining event, agent, patient, via relationship, RAD51 homolog 1, and humans. *)
  from asm have "Hypothesis x ∧ BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Humans z" <ATP>
  
  (* We know that the consequence between x and y is inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(hypothesis about BRCA2 promoting the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans, consequence between x and y) *)
  (* We can infer the consequence from the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Consequence x z" <ATP>
  
  (* The specific relationship between x and y, along with the consequence between x and y, leads to the inference that the consequence is a direct result of the specific relationship. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(specific relationship between x and y, consequence between x and y) *)
  (* We already have the consequence, so we can infer the specific relationship. *)
  then have "SpecificRelationship x y" <ATP>
  
  (* From the known information and the derived implications, we can conclude that the specific relationship between x and y, along with the consequence between x and z, leads to the inference that the consequence is a direct result of the specific relationship. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
