(* Explanation 1: PD-1/PD-L1 drugs, specifically PD1PDL1Drugs, are considered immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PD1PDL1Drugs x ⟶ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ TNBC y"
 (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC *)
 shows "∃x y e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ TNBC y ∧ HadPromisingOutcomes e ∧ In e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about immune checkpoint inhibitors and TNBC. *)
  from asm have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ TNBC y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1/PD-L1 drugs) *)
  (* We can infer PD-1/PD-L1 drugs from immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "PD1PDL1Drugs x" sledgehammer
  (* From the explanation sentence, we know that PD-1/PD-L1 drugs are considered immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x" <ATP>
  (* We already have TNBC y, so we can infer the rest of the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
