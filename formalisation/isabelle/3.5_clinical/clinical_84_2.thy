(* Explanation 1: Patients with breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 should be treated with chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ NoExpression z ∧ Of x z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: The absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression in breast cancer patients indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Absence x ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ Expression z ∧ In y x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Indicate e ∧ Need e ∧ For e ChemotherapyTreatment"

(* Explanation 3: Chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for breast cancer patients lacking expression of ER, PR, or HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. Chemotherapy x ∧ RecommendedTreatment y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ LackingExpression z ∧ Of z ER ∧ Of z PR ∧ Of z HER ⟶ TreatWith x y z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentence 1 stating that patients with breast cancer that have no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  (* This implies that the absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression in breast cancer patients indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression, indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment) *)
  (* We can infer that if there is no expression of ER, PR, or HER2, then there is a need for chemotherapy treatment. *)
  then have "∃z. NoExpression z ∧ Of x z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z" <ATP>
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have that the absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression in breast cancer patients indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment. *)
  then have "∃e. Indicate e ∧ Need e ∧ For e ChemotherapyTreatment" <ATP>
  (* From explanatory sentence 3, we know that chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for breast cancer patients lacking expression of ER, PR, or HER. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(D), Not(E)), Implies(Not(absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression), Not(indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment)) *)
  (* Since chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for patients lacking expression of ER, PR, or HER2, we can infer the need for chemotherapy treatment. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Treat y ∧ WithChemotherapy y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
