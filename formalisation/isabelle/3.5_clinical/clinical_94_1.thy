(* Explanation 1: There exists a recipient for the unavailable event *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃z e. Recipient z ∧ Unavailable e ∧ ForEvent z e"

(* Explanation 2: The recipient of the unavailable event is the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Recipient x ∧ Patient y ∧ Unavailable e ∧ ForEvent x e ⟶ ForPatient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Recipient z ∧ Unavailable e ∧ ForEvent z e"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
 shows "∃x y e. Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Unavailable e ∧ ForPatient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there exists a recipient for the unavailable event. *)
  obtain z' e' where recipient_unavailable_event: "Recipient z' ∧ Unavailable e' ∧ ForEvent z' e'" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* From the known information, we have the recipient z and the unavailable event e. *)
  obtain x where x_def: "Recipient z" by (simp add: assms)
  obtain e where e_def: "Unavailable e" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Using the derived implication Implies(B, A), we can infer that the recipient of the unavailable event is the patient. *)
  obtain y where y_def: "Patient y" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show the existence of x, y, and e such that Vemurafenib x, MEKInhibitor y, Unavailable e, and ForPatient e y. *)
  (* We can choose x = z', y = y, and e = e'. *)
  have "Vemurafenib z'" <ATP>
  moreover have "MEKInhibitor y" <ATP>
  moreover have "Unavailable e'" <ATP>
  moreover have "ForPatient e' y" <ATP>
