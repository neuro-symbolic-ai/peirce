(* Explanation 1: Overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w v e. HER2Mutation x ∧ V777L x ∧ Overexpression y x ∧ TrastuzumabResistance z ∧ SoftAgarColonyFormationAssay w ∧ ColorectalCancerCellLine v ∧ Resulted e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ By z w ∧ Of w v"

(* Explanation 2: A portion of tumors, however, ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Tumors x ∧ Portion y x ∧ Develop z ∧ Resistance z ∧ AntiHER2AntibodyTherapy y ∧ Ultimately e ∧ Patient e z ∧ To z y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ With y z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ To y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ With y z" <ATP>
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), Implies(Not(patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab), Not(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line)) *)
  (* Since the patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab, we can conclude that overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line. *)
  then have "∃x y z w v e. HER2Mutation x ∧ V777L x ∧ Overexpression y x ∧ TrastuzumabResistance z ∧ SoftAgarColonyFormationAssay w ∧ ColorectalCancerCellLine v ∧ Resulted e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ By z w ∧ Of w v" <ATP>
  (* From the above, we can infer that the patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
