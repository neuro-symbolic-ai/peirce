(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, does not directly affect trastuzumab binding to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Mutation x ∧ HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Domain y ∧ Kinase y ∧ Intracellular y ∧ Location e ∧ In x y ∧ Affect e ∧ Not (Affect e) ∧ Binding z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Domain z ∧ Extracellular z ∧ To z y"

(* Explanation 2: Trastuzumab resistance may not solely be determined by the HER2 V777L mutation due to its location in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e. Resistance x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ NotSolely w ∧ Determine e ∧ May e ∧ Mutation z ∧ HER2 z ∧ V777L z ∧ Location w ∧ Domain w ∧ Kinase w ∧ Intracellular w ∧ In z w ∧ DueTo e w"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Mutation x ∧ HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ TyrosineKinase y"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting e ∧ Mutation x ∧ HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ TyrosineKinase y ∧ Irreversible y ∧ Overcome z ∧ TreatmentResistance z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ With z y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the mutation, HER2, V777L, inhibitor, and tyrosine kinase. *)
  from asm have "Mutation x ∧ HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ TyrosineKinase y" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that the HER2 V777L mutation does not directly affect trastuzumab binding to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(C)), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation, Not(directly affect trastuzumab binding to the extracellular kinase domain)) *)
  (* Since the mutation does not directly affect trastuzumab binding, we can infer trastuzumab resistance. *)
  then have "Mutation x ∧ HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ TyrosineKinase y ∧ TreatmentResistance z" <ATP>
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence 2 indicating that trastuzumab resistance may not solely be determined by the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, Not(E)), Implies(trastuzumab resistance, Not(solely be determined by the HER2 V777L mutation)) *)
  (* As trastuzumab resistance may not solely be determined by the mutation, we can conclude that targeting the mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  then have "Mutation x ∧ HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ TyrosineKinase y ∧ TreatmentResistance z ∧ Targeting e ∧ Irreversible y ∧ Overcome z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ With z y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
