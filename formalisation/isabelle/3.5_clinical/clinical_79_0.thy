(* Explanation 1: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ ¬(AppropriateForImmunotherapy x ∨ AppropriateForPARPInhibitors x)"

(* Explanation 2: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Unavailable e ∧ CombinationVemurafenibMEKInhibitor e ∧ Patient x"

(* Explanation 3: The combination of vemurafenib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel is well tolerated and demonstrates encouraging activity, predominantly in patients with advanced melanoma and BRAFV600 mutations irrespective of prior treatment *)

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may benefit from combination vemurafenib and chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ BenefitFrom e ∧ CombinationVemurafenibChemotherapy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanation that the combination of vemurafenib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel is well tolerated and demonstrates encouraging activity. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, F), Implies(Combination of vemurafenib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel is well tolerated, Combination of vemurafenib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel demonstrates encouraging activity) *)
  (* Since the patient is x, we can infer that the patient may benefit from the combination of vemurafenib and chemotherapy. *)
  then have "∃e. BenefitFrom e ∧ CombinationVemurafenibChemotherapy e ∧ Agent e x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
