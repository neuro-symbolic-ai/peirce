(* Explanation 1: The activation of a patient with CTNNB1 mutations is entailed by the presence of activating CTNNB1 mutations in the patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y ∧ Activation e ∧ EntailedBy e ∧ Presence x y"

(* Explanation 2: The effectiveness of a specific Notch inhibitor in treating a patient is entailed by the effectiveness of the Notch inhibitor and the treatment of the patient with the inhibitor. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Specific x ∧ Treatment e1 ∧ EntailedBy e1 ∧ Effectiveness e2 ∧ EntailedBy e2 ∧ With y x"

(* Explanation 3: If a specific Notch inhibitor is effective in treating a patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations, it implies the activation of the patient and the effectiveness of the inhibitor. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Specific x ∧ Effective e1 ∧ InTreat e1 ∧ With y x ⟶ (Activation e2 ∧ OfPatient e2 y ∧ Implies e3 ∧ ActivationOfPatient e3 y ∧ Effectiveness e3 ∧ OfPatient e3 x)"

(* Explanation 4: The potential effectiveness of Notch inhibitors in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations is suggested by the effectiveness of a specific Notch inhibitor in treating a given patient with such mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ InTreat e1 ∧ With y z ∧ Specific x ∧ Effectiveness e2 ∧ InTreat e2 ∧ With y x ⟶ (PotentialEffectiveness e3 ∧ InTreat e3 ∧ With y z ∧ SuggestedBy e3 ∧ EffectivenessOfInhibitor e3 x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ With y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the Notch inhibitor, patient, and CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from asm have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z" <ATP>
  (* We can use Explanation 3 to connect the effectiveness of the Notch inhibitor in treating a patient with CTNNB1 mutations to the activation of the patient and the effectiveness of the inhibitor. *)
  (* Explanation 3: If a specific Notch inhibitor is effective in treating a patient with activating CTNNB1 mutations, it implies the activation of the patient and the effectiveness of the inhibitor. *)
  (* Given the NotchInhibitor x, Patient y, and CTNNB1Mutation z, we can infer the effectiveness of the treatment e and the relationship between the patient and the inhibitor. *)
  then have "Activation e2 ∧ OfPatient e2 y ∧ Effectiveness e3 ∧ OfPatient e3 x" <ATP>
  (* We need to find the existence of an event e that represents the effectiveness of the treatment. *)
  (* Therefore, we can existentially quantify over x, y, z, and e to show that there exists an effective treatment. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
