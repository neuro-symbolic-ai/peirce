(* Explanation 1: Patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are characterized by the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ⟶ (NoExpression x HER2 ∧ NoExpression x ER ∧ NoExpression x PR)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has breast cancer. *)
  (* We can use the information from the explanation sentence that patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer have no expression of HER-2, ER, and PR. *)
  (* This implies that the breast cancer of the patient has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y" 
  from explanation_1 have "TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ⟶ (NoExpression y HER2 ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR)"
  then have "NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2" 
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
