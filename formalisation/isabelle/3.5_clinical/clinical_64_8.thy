(* Explanation 1: A patient who is less sensitive to chemotherapy is more likely to have previously received endocrine therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ LessSensitive y ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x y ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ MoreLikely x (have previously received endocrine therapy)"

(* Explanation 2: Patients who have received endocrine therapy are more likely to exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x y ∧ MoreLikely x (exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x y ∧ Previously e ∧ BenefitFrom z ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ Target z (PIK3CA mutation)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information that the patient x has received endocrine therapy y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y" <ATP>
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, D), which states that if a patient has received endocrine therapy, they exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  (* Since the patient has received endocrine therapy, we can infer that they exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ MoreLikely x (exhibit reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy)" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis involves the concept of benefiting from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  (* We can introduce the concept of benefiting from treatment based on the given information. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ BenefitFrom z" <ATP>
  (* Additionally, the hypothesis includes the treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  (* We can introduce the treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant based on the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ BenefitFrom z ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z" <ATP>
  (* Finally, the hypothesis involves targeting the PIK3CA mutation. *)
  (* We can introduce the targeting of PIK3CA mutation based on the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ BenefitFrom z ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ Target z (PIK3CA mutation)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
