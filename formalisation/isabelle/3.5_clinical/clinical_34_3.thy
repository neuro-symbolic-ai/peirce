(* Explanation 1: If a patient has the mutation W25_H36del, then the patient has an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ W25_H36del y ⟶ (Patient z ∧ Activating z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ W25_H36del y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has the mutation W25_H36del. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ W25_H36del y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that if a patient has the mutation W25_H36del, then the patient has an activating mutation. *)
  (* We can apply this explanatory sentence to infer that the patient has an activating mutation. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Activating x" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* The hypothesis states that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient has an activating mutation and link it to CTNNB1. *)
