(* Explanation 1: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x) ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity x, if x is RAD51 homolog 1 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. (RAD51Homolog1 x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x) ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about BRCA2, RAD51 homolog 1, and involvement in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 y" and "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair z" apply simp
  (* We have the logical relations Implies(And(A, B), C) and Implies(And(D, B), C). *)
  (* Applying the first logical relation with the known information, we can infer InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans z. *)
  from explanation_1 and explanation_2 and `BRCA2 x` and `RAD51Homolog1 y` and `InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair z` have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans z" apply (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
