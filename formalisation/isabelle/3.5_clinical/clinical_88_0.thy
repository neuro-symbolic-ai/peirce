(* Explanation 1: The patient does not have a BRCA mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BRCA y ∧ ¬Have e x y"

(* Explanation 2: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ∧ Licensed z ∧ ForTreatmentOf e z x y"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor e x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient does not have a BRCA mutation. *)
  from asm obtain x where "Patient y ∧ BRCA x ∧ ¬Have e y x" <ATP>
  (* We have the information that Olaparib and Talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), Not(B)), Implies(Not(Patient has BRCA mutation), Not(Olaparib and Talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC)) *)
  (* Since the patient does not have a BRCA mutation, Olaparib and Talazoparib are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor e x y" <ATP>
