(* Explanation 1: PARP1 inhibition leads to synthetic lethality in cells with defective homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ Inhibition e ∧ Leads e ∧ SyntheticLethality y ∧ Cells z ∧ Defective z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z"

(* Explanation 2: Synthetic lethality causes cells to rely on a singular mechanism for repairing cumulative damage to DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. SyntheticLethality x ∧ Cause e ∧ Cells y ∧ Rely e ∧ On y Mechanism ∧ Repairing e ∧ CumulativeDamage DNA"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition e1 ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ May e2 ∧ Cause e3 ∧ SyntheticLethality y ∧ Cells z ∧ Rely e3 ∧ On z Mechanism ∧ Repairing e3 ∧ CumulativeDamage DNA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about patients with loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x" by meson
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that PARP1 inhibition leads to synthetic lethality in cells with defective homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PARP1 inhibition, synthetic lethality in cells with defective homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* We can infer that PARP1 inhibition leads to cells relying on a singular mechanism for repairing cumulative damage to DNA. *)
  then have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition e1 ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ May e2 ∧ Cause e3 ∧ SyntheticLethality y ∧ Cells z ∧ Rely e3 ∧ On z Mechanism ∧ Repairing e3 ∧ CumulativeDamage DNA" sledgehammer
