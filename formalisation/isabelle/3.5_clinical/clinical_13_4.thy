(* Explanation 1: The prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair is a consequence of the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2 x y z. RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ Joining y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair y ∧ Prevents e1 ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Patient e1 y ⟶ (Prevents e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 y)"

(* Explanation 2: The prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules is not always a consequence of the loss of BRCA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ Joining y ∧ ¬(∃e. BRCA z ∧ Loss z ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Joining z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Location e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA x" sledgehammer
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that states the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules is not always a consequence of the loss of BRCA. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules, prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* We can infer that the loss of BRCA does not always prevent the joining of undamaged repair molecules. *)
  (* Since the loss of BRCA does not always prevent the joining of undamaged repair molecules, we cannot directly infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot prove the hypothesis based on the given information. *)
