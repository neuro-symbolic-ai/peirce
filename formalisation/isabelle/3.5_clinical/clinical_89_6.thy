(* Explanation 1: US Food and Drug Administration approved olaparib and talazoparib for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. USFDA x ∧ Approved y ∧ Olaparib y ∧ Talazoparib y ∧ (∀z. Patient z ∧ BRCA_mutated z ∧ HER_2_negative z ∧ (Advanced z ∨ Metastatic z) ⟶ Treatment y z)"

(* Explanation 2: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors, which target tumour specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib x ∧ PARPInhibitor x ∧ Target x TumourSpecificDefectsInDNARepair"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y ∧ BRCA_mutated y ∧ HER_2_negative y ∧ (Advanced y ∨ Metastatic y)"
  (* Hypothesis: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC *)
  shows "∀x. Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib x ∧ PARPInhibitor x ∧ Treatment x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know the patient has specific characteristics related to the treatment. *)
  from asm have "Patient y ∧ BRCA_mutated y ∧ HER_2_negative y ∧ (Advanced y ∨ Metastatic y)" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(US Food and Drug Administration approved olaparib and talazoparib for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC, PARP inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair) *)
  (* We can infer that PARP inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair from the premise. *)
  then have "PARPInhibitor x ∧ Target x TumourSpecificDefectsInDNARepair" for x by (simp add: explanation_2)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors, PARP inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair) *)
  (* We can infer that Olaparib and Talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors from the previous inference. *)
  then have "Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib x" for x by (simp add: explanation_2)
  (* Combining the above inferences, we can conclude that Olaparib and Talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of the patient. *)
