(* Explanation 1: Overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2Mutation x ∧ TrastuzumabResistance y ∧ SoftAgarAssay z ∧ ColorectalCancerCellLine e ∧ Overexpression x ∧ Resulted e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ By e z"

(* Explanation 2: A portion of tumours, however, ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Tumours x ∧ AntiHER2Therapy y ∧ DevelopResistance z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ Ultimately z ∧ To z y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Beneficiary z y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ DevelopResistance e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x and Trastuzumab is y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient may benefit from Trastuzumab treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Beneficiary z y" for z <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(a portion of tumors ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that a portion of tumors ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
  then obtain a b c where "Tumours a ∧ AntiHER2Therapy b ∧ DevelopResistance c ∧ Agent c a ∧ Patient c b ∧ Ultimately c ∧ To c b" <ATP>
  (* We have the information about the patient, Trastuzumab, and the development of resistance. *)
  then have "Patient b ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ DevelopResistance c ∧ Agent c b ∧ Patient c y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
