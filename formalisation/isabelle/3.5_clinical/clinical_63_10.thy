(* Explanation 1: Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes, but not both simultaneously *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. HRR x ∧ RepairingDNA y ∧ HomologousMolecules z ∧ UsedFor e ∧ HomologousTo z (SisterChromatids y) ∧ HomologousTo z (PaternalCopies y) ∧ ¬(HomologousTo z (SisterChromatids y) ∧ HomologousTo z (PaternalCopies y))"

(* Explanation 2: If undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, then they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. HomologousMolecules x ∧ PaternalCopies y ⟶ ¬HomologousTo x (SisterChromatids y) ∧ (HomologousMolecules x ∧ SisterChromatids z ⟶ ¬HomologousTo z (PaternalCopies y))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HRR x ∧ DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y ∧ DamagedDNA z"
  (* Hypothesis: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "∃x y z e. HRR x ∧ DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ HomologousMolecules e ∧ UsedFor e ∧ (HomologousTo e (SisterChromatids y) ∨ HomologousTo e (PaternalCopies y) ∨ HomologousTo e (MaternalCopies y))"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about HRR, DSB DNA repair process, and damaged DNA. *)
  from asm have "HRR x" and "DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y" and "DamagedDNA z" <ATP>
  
  (* We know that undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes, but not both simultaneously. *)
  (* This implies that if undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, then they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa. *)
  (* These relationships are crucial for inferring the replacement process. *)
  
  (* We can consider the case where undamaged homologous molecules are related to sister chromatids. *)
  (* This implies that they are not related to paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of homologous molecules related to sister chromatids. *)
  obtain e where "HomologousMolecules e ∧ UsedFor e ∧ HomologousTo e (SisterChromatids y)" <ATP>
  
  (* We have shown that there exist homologous molecules related to sister chromatids. *)
  (* This satisfies part of the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. HRR x ∧ DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ HomologousMolecules e ∧ UsedFor e ∧ HomologousTo e (SisterChromatids y)" <ATP>
  
  (* We can also consider the case where undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* This implies that they are not related to sister chromatids. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of homologous molecules related to paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  obtain e where "HomologousMolecules e ∧ UsedFor e ∧ HomologousTo e (PaternalCopies y)" <ATP>
  
  (* We have shown that there exist homologous molecules related to paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* This also satisfies part of the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. HRR x ∧ DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ HomologousMolecules e ∧ UsedFor e ∧ HomologousTo e (PaternalCopies y)" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the two cases, we have fulfilled the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
