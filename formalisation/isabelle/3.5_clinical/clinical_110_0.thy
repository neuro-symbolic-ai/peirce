(* Explanation 1: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient_event e y"

(* Explanation 2: ERBB2 is altered in 13 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. ERBB2 x ⟶ Altered x ∧ In x 13"

(* Explanation 3: 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. BreastCarcinomaPatient x ∧ Percentage y ∧ ERBB2 z ∧ V777L z ∧ Present e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient_event e z ∧ In z 0"

(* Explanation 4: 41% of all breast carcinoma patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Percentage x ∧ BreastCarcinomaPatient y ∧ Of y x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Known y ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Known y ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient_event e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a mutation with V777L HER2. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Patient has V777L HER 2 mutation, 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0) *)
  (* Both A and C are from explanatory sentences 1 and 3. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient is part of the 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Known y ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient_event e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
