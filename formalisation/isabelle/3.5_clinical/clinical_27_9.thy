(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z w. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB y ⟶ InPathway z w ∧ CTNNB1 w"

(* Explanation 2: For any patient who has an activating mutation in CTNNB, they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z w. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB y ⟶ InPathway z w ∧ CTNNB1 w"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ InPatient z y ∧ ThisPatient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatient e z ∧ ThisPatient z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can see that the patient is targeted by a drug in the Wnt pathway. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway) *)
  (* Both A and B are from the explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  then have "InPathway z w ∧ CTNNB1 w" <ATP>
  (* Since the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway, drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
  then have "Effective e" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
