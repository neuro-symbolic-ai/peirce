(* Explanation 1: The patient having the BRAF V600E mutation implies that the patient has the most common BRAF mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x BRAFV600E ⟶ (∃z. HasMutation x z ∧ CommonMutation z)"

(* Explanation 2: The most common BRAF mutation results in constitutive hyperactivation and oncogenic transformation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CommonMutation x ⟶ (Hyperactivation x ∧ OncogenicTransformation x)"

(* Explanation 3: The patient having the most common BRAF mutation implies that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x y ∧ CommonMutation y ⟶ HasMutation x BRAFV600E"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has common BRAF V600E mutation *)
 shows "∃x. Patient x ∧ HasMutation x BRAFV600E"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by meson
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(patient having the BRAF V600E mutation, patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation). *)
  (* Using this relation and the known information, we can infer that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  from `Patient x` and `explanation_1` have "∃z. HasMutation x z ∧ CommonMutation z" sledgehammer
  (* From the above inference and the explanatory sentence 3, we can conclude that the patient has the BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  from `Patient x` and `explanation_3` and `∃z. HasMutation x z ∧ CommonMutation z` have "HasMutation x BRAFV600E" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have proven that there exists a patient x with the BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
