(* Explanation 1: Alpelisib being a kinase inhibitor implies the activation of Akt, which in turn mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Alpelisib x ∧ KinaseInhibitor y ∧ Akt z ∧ Implies e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Activation e1 ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Mediates e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Functions z ∧ Cellular z ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Alpelisib x ∧ Mutations y ∧ Pathway z"
  (* Hypothesis: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival *)
 shows "∃x y z e. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutations y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ May e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Patient e z ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival z"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Alpelisib x, Mutations y, and Pathway z. *)
  from asm have "Alpelisib x" and "Mutations y" and "Pathway z" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Alpelisib being a kinase inhibitor, activation of Akt) *)
  (* We can derive from the logical relation that Alpelisib being a kinase inhibitor implies the activation of Akt. *)
  (* Since Alpelisib being a kinase inhibitor is related to mediating numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival, we can infer that Alpelisib being a kinase inhibitor mediates proliferation and survival. *)
  then have "Proliferation z ∧ Survival z" using assms apply blast
  (* We can now introduce the concept of KinaseInhibitor x. *)
  then have "KinaseInhibitor x" by (simp add: assms)
  (* We also have Mutations y and Pathway z from the premise. *)
  then have "Mutations y ∧ Pathway z" by blast
  (* We can introduce the concept of PI3KAKT z, Target e, May e, Agent e x, Patient e y, Inhibit e, and Patient e z. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
