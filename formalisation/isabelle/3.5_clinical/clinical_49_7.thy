(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor in driving cancer development through a specific event e. The event e2, where loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, involves both driving cancer development and genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e1 e2. BRCA2GeneFunction x ∧ Factor e1 ∧ Drive e1 ∧ Patient e1 CancerDevelopment ∧ In x e1 ∧ SpecificEvent e2 ∧ In x e2 ∧ Factor e2 ∧ Drive e2 ∧ Patient e2 CancerDevelopment ∧ Involve e2 GenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2GeneFunction x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Drive e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2GeneFunction x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2GeneFunction x" by simp
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor in driving cancer development through a specific event e. *)
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence that the event e2, where loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, involves both driving cancer development and genomic instability. *)
  (* This implies that LossOfBRCA2 e2, Drive e2, Patient e2 CancerDevelopment, and Involve e2 GenomicInstability. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an event e2 that satisfies the required conditions. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Drive e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
