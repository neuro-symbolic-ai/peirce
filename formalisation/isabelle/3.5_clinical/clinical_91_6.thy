(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Purpose e ∧ Targeting e ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Manner e ∧ Recovery e ∧ From e DNADamage"

(* Explanation 3: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the role of PARP1/2 in the recovery from DNA damage is crucial *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Role e PARP1_2 ∧ Recovery e ∧ From e DNADamage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors e ∧ Target e ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e. Inhibitors e ∧ Target e ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ Role e PARP1_2 ∧ Recover e ∧ From e DNADamage"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Inhibitors e, Target e, TumorSpecificDefects e, and DNARepair e. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors e" and "Target e" and "TumorSpecificDefects e" and "DNARepair e" apply simp
  (* We can use Explanation 1 to infer Purpose e and Role e PARP1_2. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Inhibitors e› and ‹Agent e x› have "Purpose e" and "Targeting e" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* We can use Explanation 3 to infer Role e PARP1_2. *)
  from explanation_3 and ‹Inhibitors e› and ‹Agent e x› have "Role e PARP1_2" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to infer Manner e and Recovery e. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹Inhibitors e› and ‹Agent e x› have "Manner e" and "Recovery e" by (simp add: assms)
  (* Finally, we have all the necessary components to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
