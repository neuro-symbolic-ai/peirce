(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor that is involved in chromosomal stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
  shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein ∧ TumourSuppressor BRCA2Protein ∧ InvolvedIn BRCA2Protein ChromosomalStability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* BRCA2 is related to logical proposition A and B. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentence 1, we can infer HumanGene x and Encodes x BRCA2Protein. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein" <ATP>
  (* BRCA2Protein is related to logical proposition C and D. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor, BRCA2 protein is involved in chromosomal stability) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2, we can infer TumourSuppressor BRCA2Protein and InvolvedIn BRCA2Protein ChromosomalStability. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein ∧ TumourSuppressor BRCA2Protein ∧ InvolvedIn BRCA2Protein ChromosomalStability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
