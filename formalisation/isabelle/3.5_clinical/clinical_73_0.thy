(* Explanation 1: Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ A3140G y ∧ Metastatic z ∧ In x BreastCancer"

(* Explanation 2: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PIK3Ca x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent y ∧ In y BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the patient, activating mutation, PIK3Ca mutation, and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer, PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer) *)
  (* We can utilize the information from explanatory sentence 2 to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* As per explanatory sentence 2, PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
