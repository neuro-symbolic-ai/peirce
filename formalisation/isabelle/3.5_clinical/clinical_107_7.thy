(* Explanation 1: Overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2Mutation x ∧ V777L x ∧ Overexpression e x ∧ ResultedIn e y ∧ Resistance y ∧ By e z ∧ ColonyFormationAssay z ∧ SoftAgar z ∧ CancerCellLine z ∧ PortionOf z"

(* Explanation 2: A portion of tumors, however, ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Tumors x ∧ PortionOf x ∧ Develop e x y ∧ Ultimately e ∧ Resistance y ∧ To e y AntiHER2AntibodyTherapy y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e x y"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Develop e x y ∧ To e y Trastuzumab"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  from asm obtain a b where "Patient x ∧ Treatment a ∧ Trastuzumab b ∧ Benefit e x a" by <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(a portion of tumors ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Treatment a ∧ Trastuzumab b" by <ATP>
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(A, C), Implies(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* Since the patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab, we can infer the overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Develop e x y ∧ To e y Trastuzumab" by <ATP>
  then show ?thesis by <ATP>
