(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation that is directly linked to their condition of hepatoblastoma, then that activating mutation is in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ Condition z ∧ DirectlyLinkedTo y z ∧ Hepatoblastoma z ⟶ (In y CTNNB ∧ In CTNNB y)"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ Condition z ∧ DirectlyLinkedTo y z ∧ Hepatoblastoma z"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In y CTNNB ∧ CTNNB y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has an activating mutation that is directly linked to their condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ Condition z ∧ DirectlyLinkedTo y z ∧ Hepatoblastoma z" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that if an activating mutation is directly linked to hepatoblastoma, then it is in CTNNB. *)
  (* We can apply this to the premise to infer that the activating mutation is in CTNNB. *)
  then have "In y CTNNB" <ATP>
  (* Also, from the same explanatory sentence, we can deduce that CTNNB contains the activating mutation. *)
  then have "CTNNB y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that there exists a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
