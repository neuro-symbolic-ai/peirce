(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_break_repair_via_HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, HRR is a DSB DNA repair process) *)
  (* We can derive Implies(A, C), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNA_break_repair_via_HRR" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
