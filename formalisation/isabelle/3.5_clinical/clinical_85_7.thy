(* Explanation 1: Patients with breast cancer, specifically diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, are characterized by the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer e ⟶ (NoExpression e HER2 ∧ NoExpression e ER ∧ NoExpression e PR)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient is diagnosed with breast cancer and specifically with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, then the patient will exhibit the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer e ⟶ (NoExpression e HER2 ∧ NoExpression e ER ∧ NoExpression e PR)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer e"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ NoExpression e ER ∧ NoExpression e PR ∧ NoExpression e HER2"
