(* Explanation 1: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PathogenicMutation y ∧ In y PALB2"

(* Explanation 2: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient y ∧ SitesOfDNADamage z ∧ Links e ∧ In z HRRepair ∧ In z DNADamage"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ Joining e ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules y ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ In e Humans"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
 shows "∃e x y. Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Joining e ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules e ∧ In e HRRepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2. *)
  obtain p m where patient_pathogenic: "Patient p ∧ PathogenicMutation m ∧ In m PALB2" <ATP>
  (* From the known information and Explanation 2, we can infer that PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage. *)
  obtain b l s h where palb2_binding: "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner b ∧ Localises l ∧ Agent l b ∧ Patient b ∧ SitesOfDNADamage s ∧ Links l ∧ In s HRRepair ∧ In s DNADamage" <ATP>
  (* From the known information and Explanation 3, we can deduce that BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  obtain j u r v where brca2_promotes: "BRCA2 y ∧ Joining j ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules u ∧ Promotes j ∧ Agent j y ∧ Via j RAD51Homolog1 ∧ In j Humans" <ATP>
  (* Since PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 and BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules, we can conclude that the loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR. *)
  have "Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Joining e ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules e ∧ In e HRRepair" <ATP>
