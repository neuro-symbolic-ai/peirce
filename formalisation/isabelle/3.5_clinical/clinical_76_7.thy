(* Explanation 1: The catalysis of the p110 subunit in converting PIP2 to PIP3 directly leads to the conversion of PIP2 to PIP *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y. CatalysisOfP110Subunit x ∧ Leads e ∧ Conversion e x y ∧ PIP2 x ∧ PIP3 y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "P110SubunitOfPIK3 x"
  (* Hypothesis: The p110 subunit of PIK3 catalyses the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 and mediates recruitment of PI3K to plasma membrane *)
 shows "∃e x y z. P110SubunitOfPIK3 x ∧ Catalyses e ∧ Conversion e y z ∧ PIP2 y ∧ PIP3 z ∧ Mediates e ∧ RecruitmentOfPI3K e ∧ PlasmaMembrane z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the p110 subunit of PIK3 is involved. *)
  from asm have "P110SubunitOfPIK3 x" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(catalysis of the p110 subunit, conversion of PIP2 to PIP) *)
  (* We can infer that the catalysis of the p110 subunit leads to the conversion of PIP2 to PIP. *)
  then obtain e y z where "CatalysisOfP110Subunit x ∧ Leads e ∧ Conversion e y z ∧ PIP2 y ∧ PIP3 z" sledgehammer
  (* We have the conversion of PIP2 to PIP, which is related to the hypothesis. *)
  then have "P110SubunitOfPIK3 x ∧ Catalyses e ∧ Conversion e y z ∧ PIP2 y ∧ PIP3 z" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis involves mediating recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane. *)
  (* We need to add the mediating and recruitment information. *)
  then obtain z' where "P110SubunitOfPIK3 x ∧ Catalyses e ∧ Conversion e y z ∧ PIP2 y ∧ PIP3 z ∧ Mediates e ∧ RecruitmentOfPI3K e ∧ PlasmaMembrane z'" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
