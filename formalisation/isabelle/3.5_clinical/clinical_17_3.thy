(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair). *)
  (* Both A and D are from explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that BRCA2 x is a human gene involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
