(* Explanation 1: Overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Overexpression x ∧ HER2V777Lmutation y ∧ Resulted e ∧ TrastuzumabResistance z ∧ SoftAgarColonyFormationAssay z ∧ ColorectalCancerCellLine z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 2: A portion of tumours, however, ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PortionOfTumours x ∧ Develop e ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntiHER2AntibodyTherapy z ∧ Ultimately e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 3: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Benefit y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Agent y x ∧ Beneficiary y z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy *)
 shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Develop y ∧ Resistance z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Agent y x ∧ Patient z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Benefit y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Agent y x ∧ Beneficiary y z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(a portion of tumors ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that a portion of tumors ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. PortionOfTumours x ∧ Develop e ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntiHER2AntibodyTherapy z ∧ Ultimately e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the above two inferences to get the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
