(* Explanation 1: If a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, then the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Has z ∧ Agent z x y ⟶ (Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e ∧ Treatment e ∧ With x Vemurafenib)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib, then the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x y ∧ Patient y ∧ With x z ⟶ (Has z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x y ∧ Patient y ∧ With x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the patient, treatment, vemurafenib, and common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z" <ATP>
  (* There are two explanatory sentences relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* Explanation 1: If a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, then the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* Explanation 2: If a patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib, then the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* Using the logical relations Implies(A, B) and Implies(B, A), we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Since we have the common BRAF V600E mutation and vemurafenib treatment, we can conclude the rest of the information. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x y ∧ Patient y ∧ With x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
