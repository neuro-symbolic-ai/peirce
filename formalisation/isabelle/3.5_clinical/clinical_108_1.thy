(* Explanation 1: With the development of a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, trastuzumab, the prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients has dramatically improved *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Prognosis x ∧ Improved e ∧ Manner e z ∧ Dramatically z ∧ ForPatients e y ∧ WithDevelopment e x ∧ Target e x y ∧ Antibody x y ∧ Humanized x ∧ Monoclonal x ∧ Amplified y x ∧ ImprovedBy x y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Mutated y (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified y HER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e ∧ Beneficiary e x ∧ WithTreatment e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(development of a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, trastuzumab, Patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer) *)
  (* Both A and D are from explanatory sentence 2, we can infer Trastuzumab y. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients has dramatically improved, Patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer) *)
  (* We can infer Benefit e from the premise. *)
  from asm have "Benefit e" <ATP>
  (* We can infer Beneficiary e x from the premise. *)
  from asm have "Beneficiary e x" <ATP>
  (* We can infer WithTreatment e y from the premise. *)
  from asm have "WithTreatment e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
