(* Explanation 1: Patients with breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 should be treated with chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ NoExpression z ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ TreatWith e ∧ Expression y z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z"

(* Explanation 2: The absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression in breast cancer patients indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Absence x ∧ Expression y z ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ Indicate e ∧ NeedFor e ∧ Treatment e ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z"

(* Explanation 3: Chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for breast cancer patients lacking expression of ER, PR, or HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Chemotherapy x ∧ Treatment y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Recommend e ∧ TreatmentFor e ∧ ExpressionLacking e ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ In x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ TreatWith e ∧ Patient e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient should be treated with chemotherapy according to the explanation sentences. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There are relevant explanations about the treatment of patients with breast cancer lacking ER, PR, or HER2 expression. *)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression, indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment) *)
  (* Since we know the patient has breast cancer and lacks ER, PR, or HER2 expression, we can infer the need for chemotherapy treatment. *)
  then have "∃z e. Absence z ∧ Expression x z ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ Indicate e ∧ NeedFor e ∧ Treatment e ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z" <ATP>
  (* There is also a logical relation Implies(E, D), Implies(indicates a need for chemotherapy treatment, absence of ER, PR, or HER2 expression) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  then have "∃x e. Patient x ∧ TreatWith e ∧ Patient e x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
