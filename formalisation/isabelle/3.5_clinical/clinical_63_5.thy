(* Explanation 1: The undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. UndamagedHomologousMolecules x ∧ RepairingByHRR y ∧ SisterChromatids z ∧ PaternalMaternalCopies z ⟶ (RelatedTo x z ∨ RelatedTo x z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HRR x"
  (* Hypothesis: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "DSB_DNA_Repair_Process x ∧ (∃y z. DamagedDNA y ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ SisterChromatids y ∧ PaternalMaternalCopies z ∧ ReplaceBy x y z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that HRR x. *)
  from asm have "HRR x" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating the relationship between undamaged homologous molecules, repairing by HRR, sister chromatids, and paternal/maternal copies. *)
  (* We can infer that undamaged homologous molecules are related to either sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies. *)
  (* Since HRR x, we can conclude that undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are related to sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies. *)
  (* Therefore, we can deduce that there exist undamaged homologous molecules related to sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies. *)
  then have "∃z. UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ SisterChromatids z ∧ PaternalMaternalCopies z" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis states that HRR is a DSB DNA repair process. *)
  (* Based on the above inference, we can establish that it is a DSB DNA repair process. *)
  then have "DSB_DNA_Repair_Process x" <ATP>
  (* Additionally, the hypothesis mentions that damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* We have already inferred the existence of undamaged homologous molecules related to sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exist damaged DNA, undamaged homologous molecules, sister chromatids, paternal/maternal copies, and a replacement relationship with x. *)
  then have "∃y z. DamagedDNA y ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ SisterChromatids y ∧ PaternalMaternalCopies z ∧ ReplaceBy x y z" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above conclusions, we have proven the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
