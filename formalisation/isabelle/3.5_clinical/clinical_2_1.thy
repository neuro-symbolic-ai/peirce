(* Explanation 1: Synthetic lethality is when co-occurrence of multiple genetic events results in cell death *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. SyntheticLethality x ⟷ CoOccurrence y ∧ GeneticEvents y ∧ Result y CellDeath"

(* Explanation 2: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e DoubleStrandBreaks ∧ ReplicationAssociated DoubleStrandBreaks ∧ Preventing e SingleStrandBreakRepair ∧ Relying e HomologousRecombinationRepair ∧ Relying e NonHomologousEndJoining ∧ Repair e DNA"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DueTo e z ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Cause z Cells ∧ Rely z Cells ∧ Mechanism z ∧ Repair z ∧ Damage z ∧ DNA z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about patients, loss of BRCA2, PARP1, and inhibition. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, And(E, And(F, G))), Implies(PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks, E & F & G) *)
  (* We have PARP inhibitors causing replication‐associated double strand breaks, so we can infer preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error prone non-homologous end joining. *)
  then have "Preventing e SingleStrandBreakRepair ∧ Relying e HomologousRecombinationRepair ∧ Relying e NonHomologousEndJoining" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(F, G), H), Implies(F & G, repair DNA) *)
  (* Since we have defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining, we can deduce repair DNA. *)
  then have "Repair e DNA" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(B, C), A), Implies(B & C, Synthetic lethality) *)
  (* Synthetic lethality is related to co-occurrence of multiple genetic events resulting in cell death. *)
  (* We can conclude that synthetic lethality occurs. *)
  then have "SyntheticLethality z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, And(E, And(F, G))), Implies(PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks, E & F & G) *)
  (* PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks, which leads to preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error prone non-homologous end joining. *)
  (* We can infer that PARP inhibitors cause the necessary conditions for synthetic lethality. *)
  then have "Cause z Cells ∧ Rely z Cells ∧ Mechanism z ∧ Damage z ∧ DNA z" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the extracted information, we can derive the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
