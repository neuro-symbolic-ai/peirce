(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation, then the mutation is specifically located in CTNNB, and the patient is also located in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Has x y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB ∧ Has x y"
