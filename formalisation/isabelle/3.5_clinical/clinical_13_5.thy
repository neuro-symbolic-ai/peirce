(* Explanation 1: The prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair is a consequence of the loss of BRCA2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ Prevents e ⟶ ConsequenceOf e LossBRCA2"

(* Explanation 2: The loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. LossBRCA2 e ⟶ (Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ Prevents e)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossBRCA2 e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair *)
  shows "∃x. Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ Prevents e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossBRCA2 e" <ATP>
  (* The loss of BRCA2 is related to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(loss of BRCA, prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* We can infer the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules from the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ Prevents e" <ATP>
  (* The prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair is a consequence of the loss of BRCA2. *)
  (* This implies the hypothesis. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules x ∧ Undamaged x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ Prevents e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
