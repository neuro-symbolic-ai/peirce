(* Explanation 1: The repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks, such as preventing single strand break repair, defective homologous recombination repair, and error-prone non-homologous end joining, are causally linked to the occurrence of DNA repair errors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. RepairMechanisms x ∧ DoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining e ∧ OccurrenceOfDNARepairErrors x ⟶ CausallyLinked e x y"

(* Explanation 2: Defective homologous recombination repair is specifically triggered by the repair mechanisms responding to double strand breaks, indicating a direct causal relationship between the two processes *)

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining e ∧ RepairDNA e ∧ Cause e x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PARP inhibitors are involved. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x" by simp
  (* PARP inhibitors are not directly related to the repair mechanisms or DNA repair errors. *)
  (* We need to focus on the repair mechanisms and their effects. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks) *)
  (* Since defective homologous recombination repair is involved, it implies the repair mechanisms are also involved. *)
  (* This connection allows us to infer the involvement of repair mechanisms in response to double strand breaks. *)
  then have "RepairMechanisms y" for y sledgehammer
  (* Repair mechanisms responding to double strand breaks are causally linked to the occurrence of DNA repair errors. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, E), Implies(repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks, occurrence of DNA repair errors) *)
  (* Since repair mechanisms are involved, it implies the occurrence of DNA repair errors. *)
  then have "OccurrenceOfDNARepairErrors y" for y <ATP>
  (* Defective homologous recombination repair is specifically triggered by the repair mechanisms responding to double strand breaks. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks) *)
  (* Since defective homologous recombination repair is triggered, it implies the involvement of repair mechanisms. *)
  then have "SpecificallyTriggered z y" for z y <ATP>
  (* Defective homologous recombination repair is directly causally related to the repair mechanisms. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(defective homologous recombination repair, repair mechanisms involved in response to double strand breaks) *)
  (* Since defective homologous recombination repair is directly related, it implies a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms. *)
  then have "DirectCausalRelationship z y" for z y <ATP>
  (* Based on the above inferences, we can conclude that PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error-prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA. *)
