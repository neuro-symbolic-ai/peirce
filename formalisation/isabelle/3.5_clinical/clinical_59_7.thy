(* Explanation 1: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. BindingPartner x ∧ EncodedBy x PALB2 ∧ SpecificallyRequiredFor x (Localisation z DNA_Damage) ∧ Localisation z DNA_Damage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy e x ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ SpecificallyRequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z DNA_Damage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PALB2 and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x" and "BRCA2 z" <ATP>
  (* From the explanatory sentence, we know that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required, localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer the existence of a binding partner y that is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 z. *)
  then have "∃y. BindingPartner y ∧ SpecificallyRequiredFor y (Localisation z DNA_Damage)" <ATP>
  (* We can also infer that the binding partner y is encoded by PALB2 x. *)
  then have "∃x y. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ EncodedBy y x" <ATP>
  (* Additionally, we can deduce that there exists an event e where the agent is x and the patient is y. *)
  then have "∃e. Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* Finally, combining all the inferred information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
