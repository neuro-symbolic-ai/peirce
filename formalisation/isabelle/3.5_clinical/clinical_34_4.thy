(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation, then the mutation is specifically located in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Has x y ⟶ (Located e ∧ Specific e ∧ In e y CTNNB)"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In e y CTNNB"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In e y CTNNB ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the mutation is in CTNNB. *)
  from asm have "In e y CTNNB" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that if a patient has an activating mutation, then the mutation is specifically located in CTNNB. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition Implies(A, B), Implies(patient has an activating mutation, mutation is specifically located in CTNNB) *)
  (* Since we have the mutation in CTNNB and it is activating, we can infer that the patient has this activating mutation. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the information we have to conclude that the patient has the mutation and it is activating, and it is in CTNNB. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In e y CTNNB ∧ Has x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
