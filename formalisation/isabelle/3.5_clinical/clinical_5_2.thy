(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting PARP results in accumulation of single strand breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. InhibitingPARP e ⟶ AccumulationSingleStrandBreaks e"

(* Explanation 2: Single strand breaks collapse replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e1 e2. SingleStrandBreaks e1 ⟶ (Collapse e2 ∧ ReplicationForks e2 ∧ Trigger e2 ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitingPARP e"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break *)
 shows "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that inhibiting PARP results in the accumulation of single strand breaks. *)
  from asm have "InhibitingPARP e ⟶ AccumulationSingleStrandBreaks e" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inhibiting PARP, accumulation of single strand breaks) *)
  (* We can infer the accumulation of single strand breaks. *)
  then have "AccumulationSingleStrandBreaks e" by (simp add: assms)
  (* From the second explanation, we know that single strand breaks collapse replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C and D), Implies(accumulation of single strand breaks, trigger homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* Since we have the accumulation of single strand breaks, we can infer the collapse of replication forks and the triggering of homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "Collapse e ∧ ReplicationForks e ∧ Trigger e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e" sledgehammer
  (* We are interested in collapsed replication forks and double strand breaks. *)
  (* We can infer collapsed replication forks from the previous step. *)
  then have "CollapsedReplicationForks e" <ATP>
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(A, D), Implies(Inhibiting PARP, trigger homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* Since we have Inhibiting PARP, we can infer trigger homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "HomologousRecombinationRepair e" <ATP>
  (* Double strand breaks are not explicitly mentioned in the axioms or explanations, but they are often associated with the collapse of replication forks. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that double strand breaks occur when replication forks collapse. *)
  then show "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e" <ATP>
