theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Targeting(e) ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation(x) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y) ∧ Overcome(e) ∧ Patient(e, z) ∧ TreatmentResistance(z)"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting(e) ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation(x) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y) ∧ Overcome(e) ∧ Patient(e, z) ∧ TreatmentResistance(z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about targeting, HER2 V777L mutation, irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, overcome, patient, and treatment resistance. *)
  from asm have "Targeting(e) ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation(x) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y) ∧ Overcome(e) ∧ Patient(e, z) ∧ TreatmentResistance(z)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, Not(trastuzumab resistance)) *)
  (* We know that the HER2 V777L mutation may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  (* This implies that the HER2 V777L mutation may not lead to treatment resistance. *)
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(Not(B), Not(D)), Implies(Not(trastuzumab resistance), Not(resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation)) *)
  (* Therefore, the absence of trastuzumab resistance indicates the absence of resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Targeting(e) ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation(x) ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor(y) ∧ Overcome(e) ∧ Patient(e, z) ∧ TreatmentResistance(z)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
