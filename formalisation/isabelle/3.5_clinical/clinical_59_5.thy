(* Explanation 1: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. BindingPartner x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ EncodedBy x y ∧ RequiredFor x z ∧ Localization z ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ SitesOfDNA z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BindingPartner x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy e x ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localization z ∧ SitesOfDNA z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the binding partner, PALB2, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "BindingPartner x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ BRCA2 z" by simp
  (* We know from the explanatory sentence that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(binding partner encoded by PALB2 is required, localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer the required relationships to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy e x ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localization z ∧ SitesOfDNA z" sledgehammer
