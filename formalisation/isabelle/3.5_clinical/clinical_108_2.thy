(* Explanation 1: With the development of a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, trastuzumab, the prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients has dramatically improved *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Prognosis x ∧ Improved e ∧ Degree e z ∧ Dramatically z ∧ ForPatients e y ∧ WithDevelopment e x ∧ Target e x ∧ Antibody e x ∧ Monoclonal e x ∧ Humanized e x ∧ Trastuzumab y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Mutated y (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified y HER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e ∧ Beneficiary e x ∧ WithTreatment e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Mutated y (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified y HER2" sledgehammer
  (* There are derived implications Implies(C, D) and Implies(D, C). *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient has both mutations. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Mutated y (V777L HER2) ∧ Amplified y HER2" <ATP>
  (* From the known information, we can deduce that the patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Amplified y HER2" <ATP>
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(B, D), Implies(prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients has dramatically improved, patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer). *)
  (* Hence, we can conclude that the patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer due to the improved prognosis. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Amplified y HER2" <ATP>
  (* Since the patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer, we can connect this to the development of trastuzumab. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Amplified y HER2 ∧ Trastuzumab y" <ATP>
  (* Finally, based on the connection between the patient and trastuzumab, we can infer that the patient may benefit from treatment with trastuzumab. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
