(* Explanation 1: A YAP inhibitor being effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity implies a relationship between the effectiveness of the YAP inhibitor and the inhibition of β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ Relationship e"

(* Explanation 2: The effectiveness of a YAP inhibitor in inhibiting β-catenin activity leads to the inhibition of β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ Inhibition e"

(* Explanation 3: If a YAP inhibitor is effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, then it can be considered as inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ ConsideredInhibiting e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
 shows "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about YAP inhibitor and β-catenin activity. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by simp
  (* There are explanatory sentences that relate the effectiveness of a YAP inhibitor to the inhibition of β-catenin activity. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(YAP inhibitor being effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, relationship between the effectiveness of the YAP inhibitor and the inhibition of β-catenin activity) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(YAP inhibitor being effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, inhibition of β-catenin activity) *)
  (* Since we know YAPInhibitor x and βCateninActivity y, we can infer EffectiveInhibiting e, Agent e x, and Patient e y. *)
  then have "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
