(* Explanation 1: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Treatment e ∧ FirstLine e ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x"

(* Explanation 2: The best response of first-line therapy was stable disease *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Therapy y ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Of x y ∧ Stable z ∧ Disease z ∧ Was z x"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment e ∧ FirstLine e ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ After e z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is a TNBC patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that the patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient has received first-line chemotherapy, the best response of first-line therapy was stable disease) *)
  (* We can infer that the best response was stable disease. *)
  then have "Response y ∧ Best y ∧ Therapy z ∧ FirstLine w ∧ Of y z ∧ Stable w ∧ Disease w ∧ Was w y" for y z w <ATP>
  (* We can combine the information to form the desired conclusion. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment e ∧ FirstLine e ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ After e z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
