(* Explanation 1: Genomic instability can drive cancer development *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. GenomicInstability x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ⟶ Drive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity exhibits genomic instability, it can lead to cancer development *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. Entity x ∧ GenomicInstability y ⟶ (Exhibits e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y) ⟶ (Lead e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ CancerDevelopment y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ Drive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" by simp
  (* BRCA2 x is related to genomic instability, cancer development, and driving cancer development. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Genomic instability, drive cancer development) *)
  (* There is also a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Genomic instability, lead to cancer development) *)
  (* We can use these relations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* From the known information BRCA2 x, we can infer CancerDevelopment y, Drive e, Agent e x, and Patient e y. *)
  then have "∃x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ Drive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  (* We can also add the relationship between BRCA2 and genomic instability to the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ Drive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e GenomicInstability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
