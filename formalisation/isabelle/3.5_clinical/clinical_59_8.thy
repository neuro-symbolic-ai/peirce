(* Explanation 1: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. BindingPartner x ∧ EncodedBy x PALB2 ∧ RequiredFor x BRCA2 ∧ Localization BRCA2 ∧ SitesOfDNA BRCA2"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy x y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localization z ∧ SitesOfDNA z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PALB2, BindingPartner, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x" and "BindingPartner y" and "BRCA2 z" <ATP>
  (* Given the explanation sentence, we know that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that there exists x, y, and z such that BindingPartner x, EncodedBy x PALB2, RequiredFor x BRCA2, Localization BRCA2, and SitesOfDNA BRCA2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can deduce the required information for the hypothesis. *)
  then obtain e where "EncodedBy x y" and "RequiredFor y z" and "Localization z" and "SitesOfDNA z" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the obtained information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
