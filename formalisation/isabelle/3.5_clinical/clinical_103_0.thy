(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain is expected to be an effective drug for breast cancer patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Expected e ∧ Effective e ∧ Drug x ∧ For e y (BreastCancerPatients y)"

(* Explanation 2: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e x. Mutation HERV777L ∧ Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TyrosineKinase x ∧ Targeting e ∧ Overcome e ∧ TreatmentResistance e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain"
  (* Hypothesis: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain may overcome treatment resistance and be effective in breast cancer patients. *)
 shows "∃e x y. Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Overcome e ∧ TreatmentResistance e ∧ Effective e ∧ For e y (BreastCancerPatients y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about an irreversible inhibitor targeted to the HER2 kinase domain. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an irreversible inhibitor is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain, expected to be an effective drug for breast cancer patients) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since we have an irreversible inhibitor targeted to the HER2 kinase domain, we can infer it is expected to be an effective drug for breast cancer patients. *)
  then have "Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Expected e ∧ Effective e ∧ Drug x ∧ For e y (BreastCancerPatients y)" for e y <ATP>
  (* We also have the information from explanatory sentence 2 that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may overcome treatment resistance) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since we have an irreversible inhibitor and targeting information, we can infer overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  then obtain e where "Mutation HERV777L ∧ Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TyrosineKinase x ∧ Targeting e ∧ Overcome e ∧ TreatmentResistance e" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information from both explanations, we can conclude that an irreversible inhibitor targeted to the HER2 kinase domain may overcome treatment resistance and be effective in breast cancer patients. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
