(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Leads e ∧ Prevention e ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Leads e ∧ Prevention e ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the loss of BRCA2, prevention, joining, repair molecules, undamaged, and homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Leads e ∧ Prevention e ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* This implies that Loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that LossOfBRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Prevention e ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e" by blast
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
