(* Explanation 1: The activation of the PI3K pathway implies an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Activation e ∧ Of e PI3KPathway ⟶ (∃x. ActivatingMutation x ∧ Implies e x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have PIK3Ca x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating Implies(A, B), Implies(activation of the PI3K pathway, activating mutation). *)
  (* We can infer that PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x. ActivatingMutation x ∧ Implies e x" <ATP>
  then have "ActivatingMutation x" <ATP>
  (* Since PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation, it is known and frequent in breast cancer. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
