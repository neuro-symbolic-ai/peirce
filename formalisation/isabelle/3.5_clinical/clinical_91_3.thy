(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Inhibitors e ⟶ (Agent e x ⟶ (Purpose e x ⟶ Targeting e x ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e))"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. Inhibitors e ⟶ (Agent e x ⟶ (Manner e x ⟶ Recovery e x ∧ FromDamage e))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors e"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e. Inhibitors e ∧ Targeting e e ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ RoleOf e PARP1_2 ∧ RecoverFromDamage e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that e is involved with Inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors e" by simp
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Both explanations are related to the hypothesis. *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer that e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* From Explanation 2, we can infer that e is related to the recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Combining these inferences with the premise, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Inhibitors e ∧ Targeting e e ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ RoleOf e PARP1_2 ∧ RecoverFromDamage e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
