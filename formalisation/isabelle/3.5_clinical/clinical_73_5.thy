(* Explanation 1: If an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ ActivatingMutation(y) ∧ PIK3Ca(y) ∧ Has(x, y) ∧ SeenFrequently(y) ∧ In(x, BreastCancer)"
  sledgehammer
  oops
