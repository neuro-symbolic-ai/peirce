(* Explanation 1: The statement "May e" directly implies the event "EffectiveInhibiting e" according to the given explanation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Statement e ∧ May e ⟶ (Implies e ∧ Event e e ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ AccordingTo e e GivenExplanation)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ BetaCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ BetaCateninActivity y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that YAPInhibitor x and BetaCateninActivity y. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x" and "BetaCateninActivity y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(May e, EffectiveInhibiting e). *)
  (* Given that YAPInhibitor x and BetaCateninActivity y, we can infer May e and EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
  then have "May e" and "EffectiveInhibiting e" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis requires EffectiveInhibiting e and Inhibiting e. *)
  (* Since EffectiveInhibiting e is already inferred, we can introduce Inhibiting e. *)
  then have "EffectiveInhibiting e ∧ Inhibiting e" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis also requires Agent e x and Patient e y. *)
  (* We can introduce Agent e x and Patient e y based on the premise. *)
  then have "Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the necessary elements, we have the required conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
