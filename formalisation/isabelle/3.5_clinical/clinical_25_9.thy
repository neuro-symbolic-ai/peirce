consts
  May :: "event ⇒ bool"

  YAPInhibitor :: "entity ⇒ bool"
  βCateninActivity :: "entity ⇒ bool"
  Inhibiting :: "event ⇒ bool"

  Patient :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool"

(* Explanation 1: For any event "e" such that the statement holds and "May e" is true, if "May e" implies an event according to a given explanation, then the event is "EffectiveInhibiting e" *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. May e ∧ (May e ⟶ EffectiveInhibiting e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
 (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
 shows "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ May e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about YAP inhibitor and β-catenin activity. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by simp
  (* We know that May e is true and May e implies an event. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A and B and C, D), Implies(May e implies an event, EffectiveInhibiting e) *)
  (* We can infer EffectiveInhibiting e from the given information. *)
  then have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ May e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ EffectiveInhibiting e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
