(* Explanation 1: Specify that the treatment received by the patient with TNBC is chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Treatment x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ PatientWithTNBC e x ∧ Treatment e x"

(* Explanation 2: Specify that the treatment received is the first-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Treatment x ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Treatment e x ∧ FirstLineTreatment e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ StableDisease y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentences that specify the treatment received by the patient is chemotherapy and that it is the first-line treatment. *)
  (* We can use these to infer the specific treatment details. *)
  obtain a b c d where treatment_chemo: "Treatment a ∧ Chemotherapy b ∧ Received c ∧ PatientWithTNBC c a ∧ Treatment c a"
    <ATP>
  obtain e f g h where treatment_first_line: "Treatment e ∧ FirstLine f ∧ Received g ∧ Treatment g e ∧ FirstLineTreatment g f"
    <ATP>
  (* We can combine the information to derive the hypothesis. *)
  from treatment_chemo treatment_first_line have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy b ∧ FirstLine f ∧ FirstLineTreatment g ∧ Had h ∧ Agent h x ∧ Patient h ∧ Time h g"
