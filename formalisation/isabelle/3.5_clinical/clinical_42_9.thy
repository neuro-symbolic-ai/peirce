(* Explanation 1: The potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. CREBBP x ∧ Cancer y ∧ RoleIn x y ∧ LeadsTo z ∧ Directly z ∧ Relevance z ∧ ForPatient z"

(* Explanation 2: For a patient to be relevant, there must be a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Relevant x ∧ RoleOfCREBBP y ∧ Cancer y ∧ CausalLink e1 ∧ Between e1 y z ∧ RelevanceOfNCT03568656 z ∧ ForPatient e2"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. NCT03568656(x) ∧ Patient(y) ∧ RelevantFor(x, y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about NCT03568656 and the patient. *)
  from asm have "NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  
  (* We know that the potential role of CREBBP in cancer directly leads to the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(potential role of CREBBP in cancer, causal link between A and B) *)
  (* We can infer a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  then have "CausalLink e1" for some e1 using explanation_2 by blast
  
  (* For a patient to be relevant, there must be a causal link between the potential role of CREBBP in cancer and the relevance of NCT03568656 for the patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, patient is relevant) *)
  (* Given the causal link, we can conclude that NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. NCT03568656(x) ∧ Patient(y) ∧ RelevantFor(x, y)" sledgehammer
