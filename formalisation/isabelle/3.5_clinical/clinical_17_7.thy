(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumorSuppressor x ⟶ HumanProtein x"

(* Explanation 2: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a human protein and a tumor suppressor, then it is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. (BRCA2Protein x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ TumorSuppressor x) ⟶ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2Protein x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2Protein x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2Protein x" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that states if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, BRCA2 protein is a human protein) *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2Protein x, we can infer HumanProtein x. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x" sledgehammer
  (* We also have an explanatory sentence that states if BRCA2 protein is a human protein and a tumor suppressor, then it is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(B, A), C), Implies(A & B, BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* Given that we have BRCA2Protein x and HumanProtein x, we can deduce InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x HomologousRecombinationRepair" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
