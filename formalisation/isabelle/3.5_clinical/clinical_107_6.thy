(* Explanation 1: Overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2Mutation x ∧ TrastuzumabResistance y ∧ SoftAgarAssay z ∧ ColorectalCancerCellLine e ∧ Overexpression e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Resulted e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ By e y z"

(* Explanation 2: A portion of tumors, however, ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Tumors x ∧ AntiHER2Therapy y ∧ DevelopResistance e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Ultimately e ∧ However e"

(* Explanation 3: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Beneficiary e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ DevelopResistance e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is receiving Trastuzumab. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line, patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient may benefit from Trastuzumab treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Beneficiary e y" <ATP>
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), Implies(Not(patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab), Not(overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line)) *)
  (* Since the patient is benefiting from Trastuzumab, we can conclude that the overexpression of HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance. *)
  then have "HER2Mutation x ∧ TrastuzumabResistance y ∧ SoftAgarAssay z ∧ ColorectalCancerCellLine e ∧ Overexpression e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Resulted e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ By e y z" <ATP>
  (* From the above information, we can infer that the patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
  then have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ DevelopResistance e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
