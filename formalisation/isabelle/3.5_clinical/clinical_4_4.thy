(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies that it can cause chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ HumanProtein e ⟶ (Imply e ∧ Can e ∧ Cause e e ChromosomeBreakage)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HumanProtein x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that HumanProtein x. *)
  from asm have "HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies that it can cause chromosome breakage. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e x. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an event e such that LossOfBRCA2 e and it causes chromosome breakage. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
