(* Explanation 1: Activating CTNNB1 mutations result in accumulation of β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. CTNNB1 x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Result e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ AccumulationOf z beta_catenin"

(* Explanation 2: β-catenin activates expression of many genes including cyclin D1 for cell proliferation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e. beta_catenin x ∧ Activates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ ExpressionOf z w ∧ Gene w ∧ Include w cyclinD1 ∧ For z CellProliferation"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CTNNB1 x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y"
  (* Hypothesis: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. CTNNB1 x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ ProliferationOfCells z ∧ Via z beta_catenin"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that CTNNB1 x, Mutation y, and Activating y are true. *)
  from asm have "CTNNB1 x" and "Mutation y" and "Activating y" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that Activating CTNNB1 mutations result in accumulation of β-catenin. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Activating CTNNB1 mutations, accumulation of β-catenin) *)
  (* We can infer AccumulationOf z beta_catenin from the premise. *)
  then obtain z e where "AccumulationOf z beta_catenin" <ATP>
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence 2 stating that β-catenin activates expression of many genes including cyclin D1 for cell proliferation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(β-catenin activates expression of many genes, expression of cyclin D1 for cell proliferation) *)
  (* We can infer ExpressionOf z cyclinD1 and For z CellProliferation from the explanatory sentence 2. *)
  then obtain w where "ExpressionOf z w" and "Include w cyclinD1" and "For z CellProliferation" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
