(* Explanation 1: Patient with loss of BRCA2. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ LossBRCA2 x"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e x y. BRCA2 x ∧ Joining y ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Humans y ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient' e y"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  shows "∃e x y. LossBRCA2 x ∧ Joining y ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient' e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know there is a patient x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by auto
  (* Patient with loss of BRCA2 is related to the logical proposition B. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with loss of BRCA2, BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans) *)
  (* We can infer the hypothesis from the known information. *)
  then have "∃e x y. LossBRCA2 x ∧ Joining y ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient' e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
