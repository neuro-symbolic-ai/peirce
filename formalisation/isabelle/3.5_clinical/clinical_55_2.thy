(* Explanation 1: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PathogenicMutation y ∧ In y PALB2"

(* Explanation 2: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e BRCA2 ∧ To e SitesOfDNADamage ∧ Links e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e BRCA1 ∧ Patient e BRCA2 ∧ In e HRRepair ∧ In e DNADamage"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ Joining y ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules y ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ In e Humans"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
 shows "∃e x y. Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ UndamagedRepairMolecules e ∧ In e HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2. *)
  from asm obtain z where "Patient z ∧ PathogenicMutation x ∧ In x PALB2" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the information that PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage. *)
  have "∃y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e BRCA2 ∧ To e SitesOfDNADamage ∧ Links e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e BRCA1 ∧ Patient e BRCA2 ∧ In e HRRepair ∧ In e DNADamage"
    <ATP>
  
  (* We also know that BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  have "∃y z e. BRCA2 y ∧ Joining z ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules z ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ In e Humans"
    <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above information, we can infer that the loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR. *)
