(* Explanation 1: Patient with CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ With x CREBBP_BCORL1"

(* Explanation 2: Unknown relevance of fusion partner *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "UnknownRelevance FusionPartner"

(* Explanation 3: Unknown fusion and breakpoints *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "UnknownFusion ∧ Breakpoints"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ With x CREBBP_BCORL1"
 (* Hypothesis: Unknown relevance of CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion *)
 shows "UnknownRelevance CREBBP_BCORL1"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a patient with CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion. *)
  from asm have "∃x. Patient x ∧ With x CREBBP_BCORL1" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion, Unknown relevance of fusion partner) *)
  (* We can infer the unknown relevance of CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion from the patient with the fusion. *)
  then have "UnknownRelevance CREBBP_BCORL1" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
