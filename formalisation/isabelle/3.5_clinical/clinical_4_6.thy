(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly leads to chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Lead e ∧ Manner e e ∧ DirectCause e ChromosomeBreakage"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 is a direct cause of chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. LossOfBRCA2 e ⟶ DirectCause e ChromosomeBreakage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2(e)"
 (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2(e) ∧ Cause(e) ∧ Patient(e, ChromosomeBreakage)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2(e)" <ATP>
  (* We have two relevant explanation sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that Loss of BRCA2 directly leads to chromosome breakage. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that Loss of BRCA2 is a direct cause of chromosome breakage. *)
  (* From Explanation 2, we can infer that Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2(e) ∧ Cause(e) ∧ Patient(e, ChromosomeBreakage)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
