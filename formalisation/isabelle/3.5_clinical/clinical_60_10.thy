(* Explanation 1: If BRCA2 is involved in HRR in humans, then it is a human *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x Humans ⟶ Human x"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHRR x Humans"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that either BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1 is involved in HRR. *)
  consider cases
    (* Case 1: BRCA2 is involved in HRR *)
    assume "BRCA2 x"
    (* We have an explanatory sentence that states if BRCA2 is involved in HRR in humans, then it is a human. *)
    (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, B), we can infer that if BRCA2 is involved in HRR, then it is a human. *)
    (* Therefore, BRCA2 x is a human. *)
    from explanation_1 and ‹BRCA2 x› have "Human x" sledgehammer
    (* Since BRCA2 x is a human and involved in HRR, we can conclude that x is involved in HRR with humans. *)
    then have "InvolvedInHRR x Humans" <ATP>
  next
    (* Case 2: RAD51 homolog 1 is involved in HRR *)
    assume "RAD51Homolog1 x"
    (* Similar to Case 1, we have an explanatory sentence that states if RAD51 homolog 1 is involved in HRR in humans, then it is a human. *)
    (* Using the logical relation Implies(C, D), we can infer that if RAD51 homolog 1 is involved in HRR, then it is a human. *)
    (* Therefore, RAD51Homolog1 x is a human. *)
    from explanation_2 and ‹RAD51Homolog1 x› have "Human x" <ATP>
    (* Since RAD51Homolog1 x is a human and involved in HRR, we can conclude that x is involved in HRR with humans. *)
    then have "InvolvedInHRR x Humans" <ATP>
