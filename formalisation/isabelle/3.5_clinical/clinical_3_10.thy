(* Explanation 1: Defective homologous recombination repair being involved implies the repair mechanisms are also involved in response to double strand breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ⟶ (RepairMechanisms e ∧ ResponseToDoubleStrandBreaks e)"

(* Explanation 2: The involvement of defective homologous recombination repair triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms *)

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA *)
 shows "∃e x y z. PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining e ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RelyingOn e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can see that PARP inhibitors are involved, replication-associated double strand breaks occur, and single strand break repair is prevented. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks y ∧ PreventingSingleStrandBreakRepair z" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Defective homologous recombination repair being involved, the repair mechanisms are also involved in response to double strand breaks) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer that defective homologous recombination repair is involved, which leads to repair mechanisms being involved in response to double strand breaks. *)
  then have "DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ RepairMechanisms e ∧ ResponseToDoubleStrandBreaks e" for e sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Defective homologous recombination repair being involved, The involvement of defective homologous recombination repair triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 2, C is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Defective homologous recombination repair triggers a direct causal relationship with the repair mechanisms. *)
  then have "Cause e ∧ RepairMechanisms e" for e <ATP>
  (* We know that defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining are involved. *)
  then have "DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair e ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining e" for e <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
