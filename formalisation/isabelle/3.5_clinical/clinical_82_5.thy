(* Explanation 1: There exists an event where the patient with TNBC had a stable disease after treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y z. Event e ∧ Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x ∧ Time e x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Time e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* There exists an event where the patient with TNBC had a stable disease after treatment. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(patient has TNBC, patient received treatment) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, C), Implies(patient received treatment, patient had stable disease) *)
  (* Combining the above two relations, we can infer that patient with TNBC had a stable disease. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z" sledgehammer
  (* We can add the specific treatment, such as chemotherapy, as part of the treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z" <ATP>
  (* We can also specify that the treatment is the first-line treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can include the event where this treatment occurred. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Time e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
