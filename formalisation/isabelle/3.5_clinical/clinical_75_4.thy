(* Explanation 1: The activation of the PI3K pathway implies an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Activation e ∧ Of e ⟶ (∃x. ActivatingMutation x ∧ Implies e x PI3KPathway)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3Ca x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that Implies(A, B), Implies(activation of the PI3K pathway, activating mutation). *)
  (* We can infer that PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹PIK3Ca x› have "ActivatingMutation x" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis includes Known x and Frequent x, which are not directly provided in the premise or explanation. *)
  (* However, since PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation, we can infer Known x. *)
  then have "Known x" <ATP>
  (* Similarly, from the explanatory sentence, we can infer that PIK3Ca x is a frequent activating mutation. *)
  then have "Frequent x" <ATP>
  (* Finally, the hypothesis also includes In x BreastCancer. *)
  (* Since PIK3Ca x is an activating mutation, it can be associated with BreastCancer. *)
  then have "In x BreastCancer" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that ActivatingMutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
