(* Explanation 1: A TTK Inhibitor being effective in a patient implies that the TTK Inhibitor is potentially beneficial for the patient's condition *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Condition z ∧ EffectiveIn e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Implies e2 ∧ BeneficialFor e2 y z"

(* Explanation 2: The effectiveness of a TTK Inhibitor in a patient can suggest that the TTK Inhibitor may be suitable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor z y ∧ EffectiveIn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CanSuggest e ∧ MayBe e z y"

(* Explanation 3: If a TTK Inhibitor is effective in a patient, it indicates a potential positive outcome for the patient's treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Treatment z ∧ EffectiveIn e1 ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Indicates e1 ∧ PositiveOutcome e1 z"

(* Explanation 4: The effectiveness of a TTK Inhibitor in a patient may lead to the conclusion that the TTK Inhibitor could be a suitable treatment option for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z e. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ TreatmentOption z ∧ EffectiveIn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ MayLead e ∧ Conclusion e z ∧ CouldBe e x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the TTK Inhibitor and the patient. *)
  from asm have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" <ATP>
  (* We can use Explanation 2: TTK Inhibitor being effective in a patient can suggest that the TTK Inhibitor may be suitable for the patient. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(TTK Inhibitor being effective in a patient, TTK Inhibitor may be suitable for the patient) *)
  (* Both A and C are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Given TTKInhibitor x and Patient y, we can infer SuitableFor x y. *)
  then have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
