(* Explanation 1: For a patient who receives a combination treatment of Vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, there exists an event where the treatment yields better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Receives e1 ∧ CombinationTreatment e1 ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEK z ∧ Inhibitor z ∧ Event e2 ∧ Yields e2 ∧ BetterResults e2 ∧ Than e2 y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Receives e1 ∧ CombinationTreatment e1 ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEK z ∧ Inhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y z e. CombinationTreatment x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEK z ∧ Inhibitor z ∧ May e ∧ Yield e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the patient, receiving a combination treatment, Vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Receives e1 ∧ CombinationTreatment e1 ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEK z ∧ Inhibitor z" by blast
  (* We know from the explanation that there exists an event where the treatment yields better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* This implies that there exists an event where the combination treatment yields better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* We can infer the existence of an event where the combination treatment may yield better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  then obtain e2 where "Event e2 ∧ Yields e2 ∧ BetterResults e2 ∧ Than e2 y" sledgehammer
  (* Combining the information about the patient, Vemurafenib, MEK inhibitor, and the newly obtained event, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. CombinationTreatment x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEK z ∧ Inhibitor z ∧ May e ∧ Yield e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
