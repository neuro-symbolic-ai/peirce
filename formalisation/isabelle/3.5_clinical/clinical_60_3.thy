(* Explanation 1: RAD51 is a eukaryotic gene that encodes the RAD51 homolog gene *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. RAD51 x ⟶ (EukaryoticGene x ∧ Encodes x RAD51HomologGene)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x DSB_DNABreakRepair HRR)"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 promotes the assembly of RAD51 homolog 1 onto SS DNA in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. (BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y) ⟶ (Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e (AssemblyOf y SSDNA HRR))"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
  shows "InvolvedInHRR(x, Humans)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 x" apply simp
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 2 that BRCA2 is involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, BRCA2 is involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR) *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer that it is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x DSB_DNABreakRepair HRR" by (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
