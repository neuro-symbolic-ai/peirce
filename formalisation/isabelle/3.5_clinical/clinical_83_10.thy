(* Explanation 1: The initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. InitialChemotherapyTreatment x ∧ Patient y ⟶ FirstLineChemotherapy x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InitialChemotherapyTreatment x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Administered e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the initial chemotherapy treatment is given to a patient. *)
  from asm have "InitialChemotherapyTreatment x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition, first-line chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient has received first-line chemotherapy based on the explanation. *)
  then have "FirstLineChemotherapy x" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* We can construct the required conclusion using the known information and the inference. *)
  then have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Administered e y" sledgehammer
