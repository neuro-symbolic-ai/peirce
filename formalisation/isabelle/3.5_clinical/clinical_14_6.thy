(* Explanation 1: For any x and y, if there is a specific relationship between x and y, and there is a consequence between x and y, then the consequence is a result of the specific relationship. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Relationship x y ∧ Consequence x y ⟶ Result z"

(* Explanation 2: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is a direct result of the specific relationship inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y ∧ Result z ∧ InferredFrom z BRCA2 ∧ Promoting e ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e BRCA2 ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Joining z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(D, C), Implies(BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans, The consequence is a result of the specific relationship). *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer that the consequence is a result of the specific relationship. *)
  then have "Result z" for z <ATP>
  (* The consequence being a result leads to the hypothesis. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Joining z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e" for y z e <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
