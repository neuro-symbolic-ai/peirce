(* Explanation 1: For any x and y, if there is a specific relationship between x and y, and there is a consequence between x and y, then the consequence is a result of the specific relationship *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Relationship x y ∧ Consequence x y ⟶ Result z"

(* Explanation 2: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is a direct result of the specific relationship inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Consequence x y ∧ DirectResult z ∧ InferredFrom z BRCA2PromotingJoiningRepairMoleculesViaRAD51Homolog1InHumans"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"
 (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ Via z RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about BRCA2, repair molecules, undamaged, and homologous. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RepairMolecules y" and "Undamaged y" and "Homologous y" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(D), Not(C)), Implies(Not(BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans), Not(The consequence is a result of the specific relationship)) *)
  (* We can infer Not(C) from Not(D), which means the consequence is not a result of the specific relationship. *)
  (* Since we have the premise about BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules, we can infer C. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  then have "The consequence is a result of the specific relationship" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* The consequence being a result of the specific relationship implies the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
