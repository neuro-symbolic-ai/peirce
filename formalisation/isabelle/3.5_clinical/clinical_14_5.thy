(* Explanation 1: For any x and y, if there is a specific relationship between x and y, and there is a consequence between x and y, then the consequence is a result of the specific relationship *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Relationship x y ∧ Consequence x y ⟶ Result z"

(* Explanation 2: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is a direct result of the specific relationship inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y ∧ Result z ∧ DirectResult z ∧ InferredFrom z BRCA2 ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e BRCA2 ∧ Patient e RepairMolecules ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
  shows "∃x y e. BRCA2 ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(The consequence is a result of the specific relationship, BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans) *)
  (* Since BRCA2 x, we can infer the consequence is a result of the specific relationship. *)
  then have "BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans" <ATP>
  (* From the derived implication Implies(D, C), we can conclude that the consequence is a result of the specific relationship. *)
  then have "The consequence is a result of the specific relationship" <ATP>
  (* We aim to prove the hypothesis, which includes BRCA2, RepairMolecules, Undamaged, Homologous, Joining, Agent, Patient, Via, and InHumans. *)
  (* We have BRCA2, and we know that the consequence is a result of the specific relationship. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we can infer RepairMolecules, Joining, Agent, Patient, and Via. *)
  then have "BRCA2 ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
