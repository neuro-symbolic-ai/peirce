(* Explanation 1: When PIK3CA gene is mutated, it directly leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Gene x ∧ PIK3CA x ∧ Mutated e ∧ Cause e ⟶ Activation x ⟶ PI3KPathway x"

(* Explanation 2: The activation of the PI3K pathway by PIK3CA mutations results in the occurrence of activating point mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Activation x ⟶ PI3KPathway x ∧ Mutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ⟶ Results e ∧ Occurrence e ∧ ActivatingPointMutation x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3CA x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
 shows "Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3CA gene is mutated. *)
  from asm have "PIK3CA x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PIK3CA gene is mutated, activation of the PI3K pathway) *)
  (* We can infer the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
  then have "Activation x" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(activation of the PI3K pathway, occurrence of activating point mutations) *)
  (* Since we have the activation of the PI3K pathway, we can deduce the occurrence of activating point mutations. *)
  then have "Results e ∧ Occurrence e ∧ ActivatingPointMutation x" for e <ATP>
  (* The occurrence of activating point mutations implies PIK3CA gene is mutated. *)
  then have "PIK3CA x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
