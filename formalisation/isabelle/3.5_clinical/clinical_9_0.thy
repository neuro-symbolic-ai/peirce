(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e (λx. DefaultCell e (NonHomologousEndJoining x))"

(* Explanation 2: Non-homologous end joining does not use a template to repair double strand break and can cause increased genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e. NonHomologousEndJoining e ∧ ¬(∃x. UseTemplate e (RepairDoubleStrandBreak x)) ∧ CanCause e IncreasedGenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossBRCA2 e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability *)
  shows "∃e. LossBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e IncreasedGenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossBRCA2 e" <ATP>
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, E), we can infer that loss of BRCA2 can cause increased genomic instability. *)
  then have "Cause e IncreasedGenomicInstability" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that there exists an event where loss of BRCA2 causes increased genomic instability. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
