(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly influences the repair mechanism to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes in the cell *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y z. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ RepairMechanism x ∧ NonHomologousEndJoining z ∧ DefaultTo e ∧ Influences e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ InCell z"

(* Explanation 2: The loss of BRCA2 in the cell leads to the default mechanism favoring non-homologous end joining repair processes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e x y z. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cell x ∧ DefaultMechanism y ∧ NonHomologousEndJoining z ∧ Leads e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Favoring e y"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "RepairMechanism x ∧ Cell y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes *)
 shows "∃e x y. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cell y ∧ RepairMechanism x ∧ DefaultTo e ∧ NonHomologousEndJoining y ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that RepairMechanism x and Cell y. *)
  from asm have "RepairMechanism x" and "Cell y" apply blast
  
  (* We have the logical proposition Implies(A, B), which states that Loss of BRCA2 leads to the repair mechanism defaulting to non-homologous end joining repair processes in the cell. *)
  (* This is derived from Explanation 1. *)
  (* Since RepairMechanism x is part of the default mechanism, and Cell y is the cell where the default mechanism occurs, we can infer LossOfBRCA2 e. *)
  obtain e where "LossOfBRCA2 e" by (simp add: assms)
  
  (* Now, we need to show the rest of the hypothesis. *)
  (* We also have the logical proposition Implies(A, B), which states that the loss of BRCA2 in the cell leads to the default mechanism favoring non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
  (* This is derived from Explanation 2. *)
  (* Since Cell y is the cell where the default mechanism occurs, we can infer NonHomologousEndJoining y. *)
  obtain z where "NonHomologousEndJoining z" using explanation_2 by blast
  
  (* We have obtained all the necessary components of the hypothesis. *)
