(* Explanation 1: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ConsideredFor y ∧ SecondLineTreatment y"

(* Explanation 2: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ AppropriateFor y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y"

(* Explanation 3: PARP inhibitors not appropriate for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ Patient y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ SecondLineTreatment y ∧ (ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∨ PARPInhibitors x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, Not(B)), Implies(PARP inhibitors not appropriate for this patient, Not(Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors)) *)
  (* We have the information that PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  (* From the derived implication Implies(C, Not(B)), we can infer that the patient is not appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  from explanation_3 and `Patient x ∧ TNBC x` have "NotAppropriate y" sledgehammer
  then have "Not(Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(C)), Implies(Patient to be considered for second-line treatment, Not(PARP inhibitors not appropriate for this patient)) *)
  (* Since the patient is not appropriate for PARP inhibitors, we can infer that the patient is not considered for second-line treatment. *)
  from explanation_3 and `Patient x ∧ TNBC x` have "Not(Patient to be considered for second-line treatment)" <ATP>
  then have "SecondLineTreatment y" for y <ATP>
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  from `Patient x ∧ TNBC x` and `NotAppropriate y` and `SecondLineTreatment y` have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ NotAppropriate y ∧ SecondLineTreatment y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
