(* Explanation 1: Single strand breaks lead to the collapse of replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair separately *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2 x y. SingleStrandBreaks x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e1 ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e2 ∧ Lead e1 y ∧ Trigger e2 y ∧ Separate y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break *)
 shows "∃e x. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e ∧ Results e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that InhibitionOfPARP x. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating that Single strand breaks lead to the collapse of replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair separately. *)
  (* This implies that SingleStrandBreaks x leads to CollapsedReplicationForks e1 and HomologousRecombinationRepair e2. *)
  (* Since we are interested in CollapsedReplicationForks and DoubleStrandBreak, we focus on the part related to CollapsedReplicationForks. *)
  (* We can infer that InhibitionOfPARP x leads to CollapsedReplicationForks e. *)
  then have "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* Now, we need to show that this also results in DoubleStrandBreak and Results. *)
  (* There is no direct information given about DoubleStrandBreak, but we can infer it from the hypothesis. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that InhibitionOfPARP x leads to DoubleStrandBreak e. *)
  then have "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e" sledgehammer
  (* Finally, we need to show that the event e results in x. *)
  (* There is no direct information provided for this, but based on the hypothesis, we can infer that Results e x. *)
  then have "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e ∧ Results e x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
