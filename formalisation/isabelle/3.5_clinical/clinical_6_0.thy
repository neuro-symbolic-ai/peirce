(* Explanation 1: loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. BRCA2Loss x ∧ IncreasedGenomicInstability y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. IncreasedGenomicInstability x ∧ Cancer y ⟶ Hallmark x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2Loss x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z"
  (* Hypothesis: loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2Loss x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about BRCA2 loss, cancer development, and genomic instability. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2Loss x" and "CancerDevelopment y" and "GenomicInstability z" apply meson
  
  (* From the explanation 1, we know that BRCA2 loss can cause increased genomic instability. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(loss of BRCA2, increased genomic instability) *)
  (* We have BRCA2 loss, so we can infer increased genomic instability. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹BRCA2Loss x› obtain "IncreasedGenomicInstability z" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* From the explanation 2, we know that increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(increased genomic instability, hallmark of cancer) *)
  (* We have increased genomic instability, so we can infer hallmark of cancer. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹IncreasedGenomicInstability z› and ‹CancerDevelopment y› obtain "Hallmark z y" by (simp add: assms)
  
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude that BRCA2 loss drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  then have "BRCA2Loss x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z" sledgehammer
