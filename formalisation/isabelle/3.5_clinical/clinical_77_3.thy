(* Explanation 1: Binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y. Binding e ∧ P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Recruitment x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y ∧ Inhibition z"
  (* Hypothesis: Binding of the p85 subunit and p110 relieves inhibition of p110 and mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane *)
  shows "∃e x y z. Binding e ∧ P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Relieves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Recruitment PI3K PlasmaMembrane"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the p85 subunit, p110, and inhibition. *)
  from asm have "P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y" and "Inhibition z" <ATP>
  (* We know from the explanation that binding of the p85 subunit and p110 mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together, Mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane) *)
  (* We can infer that binding of the p85 subunit and p110 relieves inhibition of p110 and mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane. *)
  then have "∃e x y z. Binding e ∧ P85Subunit x ∧ P110 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Relieves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Recruitment PI3K PlasmaMembrane" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
