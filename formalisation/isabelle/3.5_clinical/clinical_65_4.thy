(* Explanation 1: Fully activated Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ProliferationAndSurvival y"

(* Explanation 2: Alpelisib is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of certain breast cancers *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Alpelisib x ∧ KinaseInhibitor y ∧ UsedInTreatmentOf y BreastCancers"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutations y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z"
  (* Hypothesis: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival *)
  shows "∃x y z e. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutations y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ProliferationAndSurvival e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about kinase inhibitor, mutations, and the PI3K/AKT pathway. *)
  from asm have "KinaseInhibitor x" and "Mutations y" and "Pathway z" and "PI3KAKT z" <ATP>
  (* There is no direct relation between the premise and the hypothesis, but we can use the known information to connect them. *)
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating that fully activated Akt mediates cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  (* This implies that Akt is related to ProliferationAndSurvival. *)
  (* Since Akt is related to ProliferationAndSurvival, and the premise involves KinaseInhibitor, Mutations, and PI3K/AKT pathway, we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹KinaseInhibitor x› and ‹Mutations y› and ‹PI3KAKT z› have "ProliferationAndSurvival e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
