(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ With e ∧ KnownMutation e V777LHER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ With e ∧ BreastCancer e V777LHER2 ∧ KnownMutation e V777LHER2"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ With e ∧ Mutation e V777LHER2 ∧ Amplification e HER2 ∧ BreastCancer e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about the patient, event, breast cancer, and known mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ With e ∧ BreastCancer e V777LHER2 ∧ KnownMutation e V777LHER2" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have KnownMutation e V777LHER2, so we can infer Mutation e V777LHER2. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ With e ∧ Mutation e V777LHER2" <ATP>
  (* We also need to show Amplification e HER2 and BreastCancer e. *)
  (* However, these are not directly provided in the premise or explanations. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot infer the full hypothesis based on the given information. *)
  (* The proof is inconclusive with the current information. *)
