(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRAF x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Role e ∧ Regulating e x ∧ Regulating e MAPK_ERK)"

(* Explanation 2: The MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. MAPK_ERK x ∧ Affects e ∧ In e (CellDivision x) ∧ In e (Differentiation x) ∧ In e (Secretion x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion *)
 shows "∃e. Role e ∧ Regulating e MAPK_ERK ∧ In e (CellDivision x) ∧ In e (Differentiation x) ∧ In e (Secretion x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRAF is a proto-oncogene, BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway). *)
  (* This implies that BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹BRAF x› have "ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Role e ∧ Regulating e x ∧ Regulating e MAPK_ERK)" <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion). *)
  (* This implies that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Role e ∧ Regulating e x ∧ Regulating e MAPK_ERK)› have "Affects e ∧ In e (CellDivision x) ∧ In e (Differentiation x) ∧ In e (Secretion x)" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an event e such that it has a role, regulates the MAPK/ERK, and is involved in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
