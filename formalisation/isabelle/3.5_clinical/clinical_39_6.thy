(* Explanation 1: Having an activating mutation in CTNNB1 implies that TTK inhibitors may be effective in the patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Mutation x ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ Implies e ∧ TTKInhibitor y ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective e ∧ In e z ∧ May e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 suggests a potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Mutation x ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ Suggests e ∧ PotentialEffectiveness y ∧ TTKInhibitor z ∧ Patient z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In e y ∧ May e"
proof -
  (* From the known information about the patient, we can use Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1: Having an activating mutation in CTNNB1 implies that TTK inhibitors may be effective in the patient. *)
  (* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 suggests a potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  (* Both explanations involve the presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 and the potential effectiveness of TTK inhibitors in the patient. *)
  (* We can infer that a TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient based on the given explanations. *)
  from asm obtain x y e where "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In e y ∧ May e" using explanation_1 by blast
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
