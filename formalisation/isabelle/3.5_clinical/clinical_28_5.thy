(* Explanation 1: An activating mutation in CTNNB1 is present in the patient with hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ With y Hepatoblastoma"

(* Explanation 2: The patient with hepatoblastoma has an activating mutation in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ With x Hepatoblastoma ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB y"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition B from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(patient with hepatoblastoma has an activating mutation in CTNNB, activating mutation in CTNNB1 is present in the patient with hepatoblastoma) *)
  (* We can infer the existence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 for the patient x. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
