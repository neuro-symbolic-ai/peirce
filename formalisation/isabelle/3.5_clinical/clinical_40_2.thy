(* Explanation 1: An activating mutation causes abnormal cell growth *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Mutation x ∧ Activating x ∧ AbnormalCellGrowth y ⟶ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has hepatoblastoma. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(patient has hepatoblastoma, presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity) *)
  (* We can infer the presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity. *)
  then have "∃y. Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  (* We also know that the activating mutation in CTNNB1 is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, D), Equivalent(patient has hepatoblastoma, presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
