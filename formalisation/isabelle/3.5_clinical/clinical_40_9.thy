(* Explanation 1: For any patient x with hepatoblastoma, if there exists an activating mutation z in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma, then the patient x has the activating mutation z in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x z. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In x z ∧ CTNNB1 z ⟶ Has x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has an activating mutation y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that states if there exists an activating mutation z in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma, then the patient x has the activating mutation z in CTNNB. *)
  (* This implies that if the patient has an activating mutation, it is linked to CTNNB1. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient x has the activating mutation y in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
