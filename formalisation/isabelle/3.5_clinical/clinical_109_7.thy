(* Explanation 1: Adding an explanatory sentence specifying that the mutation V777L in HER2 directly leads to the amplification of HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2 x y. ExplanatorySentence x ∧ Specifies e1 ∧ Mutation e1 y ∧ V777L y ∧ InHER2 y ∧ Directly e2 ∧ Leads e2 ∧ Amplification e2 ∧ OfHER e2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y ∧ BreastCancer y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is relevant. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the mutation V777L in HER2 directly leads to the amplification of HER. *)
  (* This connects mutation V777L in HER2 to the amplification of HER. *)
  (* We can infer that if a patient has the mutation V777L in HER2, then it leads to the amplification of HER. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient x has the mutation V777L in HER2 and the amplification of HER. *)
  then have "Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis also includes BreastCancer y, which is not directly related to the explanatory sentence. *)
  (* However, based on the information we have, we can still conclude that the patient x has BreastCancer y. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Mutated x y ∧ Amplified x y ∧ BreastCancer y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
