(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting β-catenin is crucial for treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. InhibitBetaCatenin e ⟶ CrucialFor e ∧ (∀x. Patient x ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation x ⟶ Treat e x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation x"
 (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃e. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ (∀x. Patient x ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation x ⟶ Treat e x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has an activating CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, Inhibiting β-catenin) *)
  (* We can infer that inhibiting β-catenin is crucial for treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations from the explanation. *)
  (* Therefore, inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "∃e. InhibitBetaCatenin e ∧ Effective e ∧ (∀x. Patient x ∧ ActivatingCTNNB1Mutation x ⟶ Treat e x)" sledgehammer
