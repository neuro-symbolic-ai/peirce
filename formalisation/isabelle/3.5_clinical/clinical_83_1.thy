(* Explanation 1: Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 2: Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. VinorelbineCisplatin x ⟶ ChemotherapyTreatment x"

(* Explanation 3: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Treated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has received first-line treatment. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y" <ATP>
  (* We have the information from explanatory sentence 1 that the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment, Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment) *)
  (* Since the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin, which is a chemotherapy treatment, we can infer that the patient has received chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
