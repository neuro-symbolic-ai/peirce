(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRAF x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x MAPK_ERK ∧ Patient e x SignalingPathway)"

(* Explanation 2: The MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e x y. MAPK_ERK x ∧ SignalingPathway y ∧ Affects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x y ∧ Patient e x CellDivision ∧ Patient e x Differentiation ∧ Patient e x Secretion"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion *)
 shows "∃e x y z. BRAF x ∧ Role y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Regulation e ∧ Agent e x BRAF ∧ Patient e x y ∧ Patient e x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRAF. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRAF is a proto-oncogene, BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x MAPK_ERK ∧ Patient e x SignalingPathway)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(BRAF plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion) *)
  (* We can infer that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then obtain e x y where "MAPK_ERK x ∧ SignalingPathway y ∧ Affects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x y ∧ Patient e x CellDivision ∧ Patient e x Differentiation ∧ Patient e x Secretion" <ATP>
  (* We have all the necessary components to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
