(* Explanation 1: Patient PD-L1 status unknown *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PD_L1Status y ∧ Unknown y"

(* Explanation 2: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ TNBC z ∧ HaveHad e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient_event e y ∧ In e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ AppropriateForICIs e ∧ WillBe e ∧ Unknown e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient's PD-L1 status is unknown. *)
  from asm and explanation_1 obtain "∃y. PD_L1Status y ∧ Unknown y" by auto
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient's unknown PD-L1 status makes it uncertain whether they will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "∃x e. Patient x ∧ AppropriateForICIs e ∧ WillBe e ∧ Unknown e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis by auto
