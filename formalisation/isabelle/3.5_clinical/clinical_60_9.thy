(* Explanation 1: If an entity is involved in HRR in humans, then it is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (InvolvedInHRRInHumans x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x)"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is involved in HRR in humans, then it is a human. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. (InvolvedInHRRInHumans x ⟶ Human x)"

(* Explanation 3: If an entity is a human, then it is involved in HRR in humans. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (Human x ⟶ InvolvedInHRRInHumans x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans. *)
 shows "InvolvedInHRR x ∧ Human x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 x" apply simp
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer that if an entity is involved in HRR in humans, then it is involved in HRR. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an entity is involved in HRR in humans, an entity is involved in HRR) *)
  (* We have BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x, so we can infer that they are involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR x" by (simp add: assms)
  (* From Explanation 2, if an entity is involved in HRR in humans, then it is a human. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(an entity is involved in HRR in humans, an entity is a human) *)
  (* Since BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 x are involved in HRR, they are humans. *)
  then have "Human x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
