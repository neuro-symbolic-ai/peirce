(* Explanation 1: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and is specifically required for this process *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BindingPartner x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ RequiredFor x (Localisation z DNA_Damage) ∧ RequiredFor x Process"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z DNA_Damage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about PALB2 and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x" and "BRCA2 y" <ATP>
  (* The explanation sentence states that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for this process. *)
  (* We can infer that PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ EncodedBy e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z DNA_Damage" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
