theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MutationInBRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MutationInBRAF x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion e ∧ Affects e x y ∧ Affects e x z ∧ Affects e x e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know there is a mutation in BRAF. *)
  from asm have "MutationInBRAF x" by simp
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that changes in MAPK/ERK regulation due to a BRAF mutation lead to effects on cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that alterations in downstream signaling pathways from a BRAF mutation play a crucial role in mediating the impact on cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* We can infer that a mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "MutationInBRAF x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion e" sledgehammer
  (* The effects on cell division, differentiation, and secretion are due to the mutation in BRAF. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the mutation in BRAF affects these processes. *)
  then have "Affects e x y ∧ Affects e x z ∧ Affects e x e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
