(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. PARP1_2Inhibitors x ∧ AnticancerAgents y ∧ Target x ∧ Purpose x y"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPribosylation z ∧ Involved x z ∧ Involved y z ∧ Important z ∧ Processes z ∧ RecoveryFromDNADamage z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1_2Inhibitors x ∧ TumourSpecificDefects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. PARP1_2Inhibitors x ∧ TumourSpecificDefects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e y ∧ Manner e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about PARP1/2 inhibitors, tumor-specific defects, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "PARP1_2Inhibitors x" and "TumourSpecificDefects y" and "DNARepair z" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies([PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents, [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is the hypothesis we want to prove. *)
  (* We already have PARP1_2Inhibitors x, TumourSpecificDefects y, and DNARepair z, so we can infer the rest of the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. PARP1_2Inhibitors x ∧ TumourSpecificDefects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e y ∧ Manner e z" apply (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
