(* Explanation 1: Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes, but not both simultaneously *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. UndamagedHomologousMolecules x ∧ RepairingDNAByHRR y ∧ RelatedTo e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ (SpecificallyRelatedTo e SisterChromatids ∨ SpecificallyRelatedTo e PaternalCopies) ∧ ¬(SpecificallyRelatedTo e SisterChromatids ∧ SpecificallyRelatedTo e PaternalCopies)"

(* Explanation 2: If undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, then they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. UndamagedHomologousMolecules x ∧ RelatedTo y ∧ PaternalCopies z ⟶ ¬SpecificallyRelatedTo x SisterChromatids ∧ SpecificallyRelatedTo x PaternalCopies ∧ (SpecificallyRelatedTo x SisterChromatids ⟶ ¬SpecificallyRelatedTo x PaternalCopies)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "RepairingDNAByHRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DamagedDNA z"
  (* Hypothesis: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "∃x y z e. HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules e ∧ Replace e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ From e y ∧ (HomologousTo e SisterChromatids ∨ HomologousTo e PaternalCopies ∨ HomologousTo e MaternalCopies)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about repairing DNA by HRR, DSB repair process, and damaged DNA. *)
  from asm have "RepairingDNAByHRR x" and "DSBRepairProcess y" and "DamagedDNA z" <ATP>
  
  (* We know from Explanation 1 that undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* This implies that if they are related to paternal copies, they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that undamaged homologous molecules are related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies, but not both simultaneously. *)
  
  (* We also know from Explanation 2 that if undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, then they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa. *)
  
  (* Based on the above, we can conclude that undamaged homologous molecules are related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies, but not both simultaneously. *)
  
  (* Therefore, we can include the undamaged homologous molecules in the conclusion along with the other information we have. *)
  (* We can also include the relationship 'Replace' between the undamaged homologous molecules and the damaged DNA. *)
  (* Additionally, we can include the relationship between the undamaged homologous molecules and the event, agent, patient, and source of the molecules. *)
  (* Finally, we can include the relationship between the undamaged homologous molecules and sister chromatids, paternal copies, or maternal copies. *)
