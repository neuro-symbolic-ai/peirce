  V777L :: "event ⇒ bool"
  Amplification :: "event ⇒ bool"
  HER :: "event ⇒ bool"
  Patient :: "entity ⇒ bool"

(* Explanation 1: The mutation V777L in HER2 directly leads to the amplification of HER *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Mutation e ∧ HER2 e ∧ V777L e ⟶ Amplification e ∧ HER e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Mutated e ∧ Amplified e ∧ HER2 e ∧ V777L e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the mutation V777L in HER2 directly leads to the amplification of HER. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the mutation V777L in HER2 leads to amplification of HER. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has the mutation V777L in HER2 and HER2 amplified. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Mutation e ∧ Amplification e ∧ HER2 e ∧ V777L e" sledgehammer
