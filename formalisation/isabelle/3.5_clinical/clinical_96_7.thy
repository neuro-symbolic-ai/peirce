(* Explanation 1: Patient has common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Common y ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATPbinding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z w. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ LowMolecularWeight y ∧ OrallyAvailable y ∧ BindsTo x z ∧ ATPbindingSite z ∧ BRAF_V600E_Kinase z ∧ Inhibits x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600E_Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600E_Mutation z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation and is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  from asm obtain a b where "Patient x ∧ Common b ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation b ∧ Has x b ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600E_Mutation z" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Patient has common BRAF V600E mutation, selectively binds to the ATPbinding site of BRAF V600E kinase) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient's mutation leads to the binding to the ATPbinding site of BRAF V600E kinase. *)
  then obtain c where "BindsTo z c ∧ ATPbindingSite c ∧ BRAF_V600E_Kinase c" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(selectively binds to the ATPbinding site of BRAF V600E kinase, inhibits the activity of BRAF V600E kinase) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the treatment with vemurafenib inhibits the activity of BRAF V600E kinase. *)
  then obtain e where "Inhibits z e" <ATP>
  (* We have all the necessary components to show that the patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
