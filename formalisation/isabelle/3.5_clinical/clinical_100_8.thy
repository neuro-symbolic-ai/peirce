(* Explanation: BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion, as well as plays a specific role in these processes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation: "∃x y e. Regulation BRAF MAPK_ERK e ∧ Influences e CellDivision ∧ Influences e Differentiation ∧ Influences e Secretion ∧ Role BRAF SpecificRole ∧ In BRAF CellDivision ∧ In BRAF Differentiation ∧ In BRAF Secretion"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Role x y ∧ In y CellDivision ∧ In y Differentiation ∧ In y Secretion"
  (* Hypothesis: BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion through its regulation of MAPK/ERK. *)
 shows "∃x e. BRAF x ∧ Role e ∧ In e CellDivision ∧ In e Differentiation ∧ In e Secretion ∧ Regulation x MAPK_ERK e"
