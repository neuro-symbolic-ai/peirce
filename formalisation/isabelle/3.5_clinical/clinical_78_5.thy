(* Explanation 1: The relief of the inhibitory effect on p is directly caused by the binding of the catalytic subunit by the regulatory subunit *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2 x y z. Relief e1 ∧ InhibitoryEffect x ∧ Directly e2 ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 x ∧ Binding e1 ∧ CatalyticSubunit e1 z ∧ RegulatorySubunit e1 y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CatalyticSubunit p110 ∧ RegulatorySubunit p85"
  (* Hypothesis: Binding of the catalytic subunit (p110) of PI3K by the regulatory subunit (p85) relieves the inhibitory effect on p110 *)
 shows "∃e x y z. Binding e ∧ CatalyticSubunit x ∧ RegulatorySubunit y ∧ InhibitoryEffect z ∧ Relief e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Directly e ∧ Cause e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the catalytic subunit and the regulatory subunit. *)
  from asm have "CatalyticSubunit p110 ∧ RegulatorySubunit p85" <ATP>
  (* From the explanatory sentence, we know that the relief of the inhibitory effect on p is directly caused by the binding of the catalytic subunit by the regulatory subunit. *)
  (* This implies that the binding of the catalytic subunit by the regulatory subunit relieves the inhibitory effect on p. *)
  (* We can infer the necessary components for the hypothesis from the explanatory sentence. *)
  then have "∃e x y z. Binding e ∧ CatalyticSubunit x ∧ RegulatorySubunit y ∧ InhibitoryEffect z ∧ Relief e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Directly e ∧ Cause e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
