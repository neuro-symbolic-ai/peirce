(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2 x ∧ V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Located x intracellular kinase domain ∧ Contribute e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e trastuzumab ∧ Not (Contribute e) ∧ Reason e trastuzumab binds extracellular kinase domain"

(* Explanation 2: The resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Resistance x ∧ InducedBy x HER2-activating mutation ∧ Related e ∧ Not (Related e) ∧ Degree e directly ∧ Comparison e HER2 V777L mutation"

(* Explanation 3: There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Mechanism x ∧ Identify e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e HER2 V777L mutation ∧ Lead e ∧ Agent e HER2 V777L mutation ∧ Patient e treatment resistance trastuzumab"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Resistance x ∧ InducedBy x HER2-activating mutation"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting x HERV777L y z ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ Irreversible y ∧ TyrosineKinase y ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Resistance z ∧ Treatment z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
  from asm have "Resistance x" and "InducedBy x HER2-activating mutation" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, A), Implies(resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation, HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain) *)
  (* Since there is resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation, we can infer that the HER2 V777L mutation is located in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
  then have "HER2 V777L x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, E), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, specific mechanism identified) *)
  (* Given that the HER2 V777L mutation is located in the intracellular kinase domain, we can conclude that there is a specific mechanism identified. *)
  then have "Mechanism x" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 3, we can see that the identified mechanism leads to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  then have "Identify e" and "Through e HER2 V777L x" and "Lead e" and "Agent e HER2 V777L x" and "Patient e treatment resistance trastuzumab" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis states that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  (* We can construct the required elements for the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Targeting x HERV777L y z" and "Inhibitor y" and "Irreversible y" and "TyrosineKinase y" and "Overcome e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e z" and "Resistance z" and "Treatment z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
