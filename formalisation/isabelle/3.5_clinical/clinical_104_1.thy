(* Explanation 1: The HER2 V777L mutation, located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IntracellularKinaseDomain y ∧ TrastuzumabResistance z ∧ Contribute e ∧ ¬Directly e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ As e TrastuzumabBindsToExtracellularKinaseDomain"

(* Explanation 2: The resistance induced by a HER2-activating mutation may not be directly related to the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ResistanceInducedByHER2ActivatingMutation x ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation y ∧ ¬Related e ∧ Directly e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: There is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Identify e ∧ SpecificMechanism x ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Lead e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentResistanceToTrastuzab z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Targeting e ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentResistance z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the HER2 V777L mutation and the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "HER2_V777L_Mutation x" and "IrreversibleTyrosineKinaseInhibitor y" <ATP>
  
  (* We know from Explanation 1 that the HER2 V777L mutation may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, may not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance) *)
  (* We can infer that the HER2 V777L mutation does not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance. *)
  then have "¬Contribute e" <ATP>
  
  (* From Explanation 3, we know that there is a need to identify a specific mechanism through which the HER2 V777L mutation could lead to treatment resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  (* We can infer that there is a specific mechanism that leads to treatment resistance. *)
  then have "Identify e ∧ SpecificMechanism x ∧ Lead e ∧ TreatmentResistanceToTrastuzab z" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above information, we can conclude that targeting the HER2 V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
