(* Explanation 1: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cell z ∧ BetaCatenin e ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via y z"

(* Explanation 2: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ BetaCatenin y ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Activating mutations of CTNNB1, promote proliferation of cells) *)
  (* We can infer that activating mutations of CTNNB1 lead to promoting proliferation of cells. *)
  then have "Proliferation y ∧ Cell z ∧ BetaCatenin e ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ Via y z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Activating mutations of CTNNB1, via β-catenin) *)
  (* We can deduce that activating mutations of CTNNB1 are related to via β-catenin. *)
  then have "BetaCatenin e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, F), Implies(A YAP inhibitor, may be effective) *)
  (* We have YAPInhibitor x and BetaCatenin e, so we can conclude that a YAP inhibitor inhibits β-catenin activity. *)
  then have "Effective e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the necessary information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
