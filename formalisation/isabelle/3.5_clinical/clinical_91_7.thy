(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e ⟶ (Purpose e Targeting ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e)"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e ⟶ (Manner e Recovery ∧ DNARepair e)"

(* Explanation 3: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the role of PARP1/2 in the recovery from DNA damage is crucial *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e ⟶ (Role e PARP1 ∧ Crucial e)"

(* Explanation 4: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is dependent on the role of PARP1/2 in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀e. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e ⟶ (Dependent e ∧ Role e PARP1 ∧ DNARepair e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors e"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ Role e PARP1 ∧ Manner e Recovery"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that e is related to inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors e" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4 which are relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* Using Implies(A, B), Implies(A, C), Implies(A, D), and Implies(A, E) *)
  (* We can infer the necessary components of the hypothesis. *)
  from explanation_1[rule_format, of e] and explanation_2[rule_format, of e] and explanation_3[rule_format, of e] and explanation_4[rule_format, of e] and asm
  have "TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ Role e PARP1 ∧ Manner e Recovery" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
