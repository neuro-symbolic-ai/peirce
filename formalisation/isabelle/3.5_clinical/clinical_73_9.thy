(* Explanation 1: If an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (Has x y ∧ Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Has x y ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ Patient x ∧ PIK3Ca y) ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 3: The activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient is frequently seen in breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequently y BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ ActivatingMutation(y) ∧ PIK3Ca(y) ∧ Has(x, y) ∧ SeenFrequently(y, BreastCancer)"
  sledgehammer
  oops
