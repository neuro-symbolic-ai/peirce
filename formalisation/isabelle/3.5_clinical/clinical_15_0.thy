(* Explanation 1: RAD51 is a eukaryotic gene that encodes the RAD51 homolog gene *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. RAD51 x ⟶ EukaryoticGene x ∧ Encodes x RAD51HomologGene"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 promotes the assembly of RAD51 homolog 1 onto single strand DNA in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ SingleStrandDNA y ∧ Assembly e ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ InHomologousRecombinationRepair e"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA repair via homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInDoubleStrandBreakDNARepair x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ Human x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 x" apply auto[1]
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, C), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, BRCA2 promotes the assembly of RAD51 homolog 1 onto single strand DNA in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer the involvement in the assembly of RAD51 homolog 1 onto single strand DNA in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "Assembly e ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e x ∧ InHomologousRecombinationRepair e" for e by (simp add: assms)
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, BRCA2 is involved in double strand break DNA repair via homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer the involvement in double strand break DNA repair via homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "InvolvedInDoubleStrandBreakDNARepair x ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair x" using explanation_3 by blast
  
  (* Since BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair, we can conclude that x is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" sledgehammer
  
  (* Since BRCA2 is a human protein, we can conclude that x is a human. *)
  then have "Human x" <ATP>
  
  (* Therefore, we have shown that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
