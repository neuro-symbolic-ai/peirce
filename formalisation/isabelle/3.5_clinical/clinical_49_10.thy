(* Explanation 1: The event e2, where the loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, directly leads to genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e2. Event e2 ∧ Factor e2 LossBRCA2 ∧ Leads e2 GenomicInstability ∧ Directly e2"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 gene function in event e2 results in the development of genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e2. LossBRCA2GeneFunction e2 ∧ Results e2 DevelopmentGenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossBRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
  shows "∃e. LossBRCA2 e ∧ Drives e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that LossBRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "LossBRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentences that LossBRCA2 gene function in event e2 leads to genomic instability. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, genomic instability) *)
  (* We can infer that LossBRCA2 gene function in event e2 leads to genomic instability. *)
  then have "∃e2. Event e2 ∧ Factor e2 LossBRCA2 ∧ Leads e2 GenomicInstability ∧ Directly e2" <ATP>
  then have "∃e2. LossBRCA2GeneFunction e2 ∧ Results e2 DevelopmentGenomicInstability" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, there exists an event e2 where the loss of BRCA2 gene function results in the development of genomic instability. *)
  (* We can conclude that the loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
