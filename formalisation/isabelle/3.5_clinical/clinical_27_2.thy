(* Explanation 1: If drugs are targeting the Wnt pathway, then they may be effective in this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ⟶ (Effective e ∧ In e z ∧ Cause e z)"

(* Explanation 2: If drugs are targeting the Wnt pathway, then they are targeting the Wnt pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ⟶ Targeting x WntPathway"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective e ∧ In e z ∧ Cause e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is z. *)
  from asm have "Patient z" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that if drugs target the Wnt pathway, they may be effective in the patient. *)
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence 2 stating that if drugs target the Wnt pathway, then they are targeting the Wnt pathway. *)
  (* Combining these two, we can infer that if drugs target the Wnt pathway, they are effective in the patient. *)
  then have "Drugs x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective e ∧ In e z ∧ Cause e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
