(* Explanation 1: The activating mutation PIK3Ca is specifically implied by the activation of the PI3K pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PIK3Ca x ⟶ ImpliedBy x (Activation x PI3KPathway)"

(* Explanation 2: The activating mutation PIK3Ca is known and frequent in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. PIK3Ca x ⟶ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
 shows "Activation x PI3KPathway ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3Ca x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(activating mutation PIK3Ca, known and frequent in breast cancer). *)
  (* Using the explanatory sentence 2, we can infer Known x ∧ Frequent x. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹PIK3Ca x› have "Known x ∧ Frequent x" <ATP>
  (* Since we have Known x ∧ Frequent x, we can conclude that PIK3Ca is known and frequent. *)
  then have "Known x" and "Frequent x" <ATP>
  (* Additionally, from the logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(activation of the PI3K pathway, activating mutation PIK3Ca), we can infer Activation x PI3KPathway. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹PIK3Ca x› have "ImpliedBy x (Activation x PI3KPathway)" <ATP>
  then have "Activation x PI3KPathway" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can combine all the inferred information to show the desired conclusion. *)
  then show "Activation x PI3KPathway ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" <ATP>
