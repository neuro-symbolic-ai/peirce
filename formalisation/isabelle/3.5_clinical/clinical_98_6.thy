(* Explanation 1: The mutation locus found in codon 600 of exon 15 (V600E) of the BRAF gene specifically corresponds to the mutation BRAF V600E *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. MutationLocus x ∧ FoundIn x (Codon600 x) ∧ FoundIn x (Exon15 x) ∧ FoundIn x (V600E x) ∧ OfGene x (BRAF x) ⟶ CorrespondsTo x (BRAFV600E x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAFV600E x"
 (* Hypothesis: BRAF V600E is the most common BRAF mutation and results in constitutive hyperactivation and oncogenic transformation *)
 shows "CommonMutation x ∧ ResultsIn x (Hyperactivation x) ∧ ResultsIn x (Transformation x)"
proof -
  (* From the hypothesis, we know that BRAFV600E x is true. *)
  from asm have "BRAFV600E x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(mutation BRAF V600E, mutation locus found in codon 600 of exon 15 of the BRAF gene) *)
  (* We can infer that mutation locus found in codon 600 of exon 15 of the BRAF gene is true. *)
  then have "MutationLocus x ∧ FoundIn x (Codon600 x) ∧ FoundIn x (Exon15 x) ∧ FoundIn x (V600E x) ∧ OfGene x (BRAF x)" <ATP>
  (* From the explanatory sentence, we have Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(mutation locus found in codon 600 of exon 15 of the BRAF gene, mutation BRAF V600E) *)
  (* Since we have mutation locus found in codon 600 of exon 15 of the BRAF gene, we can conclude mutation BRAF V600E. *)
  then have "BRAFV600E x" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis is already BRAFV600E x, so we can directly infer the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
