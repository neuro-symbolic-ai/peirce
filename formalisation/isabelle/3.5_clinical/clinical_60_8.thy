(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if x is involved in HRR in humans, then x is involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (InvolvedInHRR x ∧ Human x) ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is involved in HRR, then it is involved in HRR in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedInHRR x ⟶ (Human x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x)"

(* Explanation 3: If RAD51Homolog1 is involved in HRR in humans, then RAD51Homolog1 is involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "RAD51Homolog1 x ∧ Human x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x ⟶ RAD51Homolog1 x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ Human x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Human y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHRR x ∧ InvolvedInHRR y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about BRCA2, RAD51Homolog1, and humans. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "Human x" and "RAD51Homolog1 y" and "Human y" apply simp
  
  (* We know that if an entity is involved in HRR, then it is involved in HRR in humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation ForAll(x, Implies(InvolvedInHRRInHumans(x), InvolvedInHRR(x))) *)
  (* We can apply this relation to BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 y. *)
  (* From Explanation 1 and Explanation 2, we can infer that BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 y are involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR x" and "InvolvedInHRR y" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We also know that if RAD51Homolog1 is involved in HRR in humans, then it is involved in HRR. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(RAD51Homolog1 is involved in HRR in humans, RAD51Homolog1 is involved in HRR) *)
  (* We can apply this relation to RAD51Homolog1 y. *)
  (* From Explanation 3, we can infer that RAD51Homolog1 y is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR y" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* Therefore, we have shown that BRCA2 x and RAD51Homolog1 y are both involved in HRR. *)
