(* Explanation 1: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. BRAF x ∧ RegulationOf x y ∧ Play y ∧ Role z ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Agent y x"

(* Explanation 2: A BRAF mutation is a spontaneous change in the BRAF gene that causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. BRAFMutation x ∧ SpontaneousChange y ∧ BRAFGene z ∧ Cause y ∧ TurnOn z Protein ∧ KeepOn z Protein"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
 shows "∃x y. MutationInBRAF x ∧ Affect y ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ∧ Agent y x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by simp
  (* BRAF is related to the regulation of MAPK/ERK, which plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* There is an implication Implies(A, B), Implies(regulation of MAPK/ERK by BRAF, BRAF plays a role in cell division) *)
  (* There is an implication Implies(A, C), Implies(regulation of MAPK/ERK by BRAF, BRAF plays a role in differentiation) *)
  (* There is an implication Implies(A, D), Implies(regulation of MAPK/ERK by BRAF, BRAF plays a role in secretion) *)
  (* These implications allow us to infer that BRAF affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  from explanation_1 and `BRAF x` obtain "∃z. CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Agent y x" by auto
  then have "∃x y. MutationInBRAF x ∧ Affect y ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ∧ Agent y x" sledgehammer
