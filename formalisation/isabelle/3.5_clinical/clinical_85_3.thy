(* Explanation 1: Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are specifically identified by the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ∧ Patient y ∧ DiagnosedWith y x ⟶ (IdentifiedBy y x (AbsenceOf x HER2) ∧ AbsenceOf x ER ∧ AbsenceOf x PR)"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has breast cancer. *)
  have "BreastCancer y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition A: Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), B), Implies(Not(Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer), absence of HER-2 expression) *)
  (* Since the patient has breast cancer, we can infer the absence of HER-2 expression. *)
  then have "NoExpression y HER2" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), C), Implies(Not(Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer), absence of ER expression) *)
  (* Since the patient has breast cancer, we can infer the absence of ER expression. *)
  then have "NoExpression y ER" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), D), Implies(Not(Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer), absence of PR expression) *)
  (* Since the patient has breast cancer, we can infer the absence of PR expression. *)
  then have "NoExpression y PR" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the necessary conditions, we have the required conclusion. *)
