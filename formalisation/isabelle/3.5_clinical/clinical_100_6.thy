(* Explanation 1: BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway directly influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Regulation e ∧ MAPK_ERK e ∧ Influences e ∧ CellDivision x ∧ Differentiation x ∧ Secretion x ∧ Directly e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
 shows "∃e x. BRAF x ∧ Regulation e ∧ MAPK_ERK e ∧ Plays e ∧ RoleIn e x ∧ CellDivision x ∧ Differentiation x ∧ Secretion x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by auto
  (* We have the explanatory sentence stating that BRAF's regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway directly influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* There are logical relations Implies(A, B), Implies(A, C), and Implies(A, D) *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF's regulation of MAPK/ERK influences cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "∃e x. BRAF x ∧ Regulation e ∧ MAPK_ERK e ∧ Plays e ∧ RoleIn e x ∧ CellDivision x ∧ Differentiation x ∧ Secretion x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
