(* Explanation 1: If inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, then it also inhibits β-catenin *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 2: If inhibiting β-catenin, then it is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. Inhibit e ⟶ (Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Patient e ∧ Activating e ∧ CTNNB1 e ∧ Mutation e)"

(* Explanation 3: For any event where inhibiting β-catenin is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, it also inhibits β-catenin *)
axiomatization where

  (* Hypothesis: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
