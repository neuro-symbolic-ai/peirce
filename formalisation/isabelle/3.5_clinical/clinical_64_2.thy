(* Explanation 1: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. KinaseInhibitor e ⟶ Target e Mutations ∧ Target e PI3KAKTpathway ∧ Inhibit e Proliferation ∧ Inhibit e Survival"

(* Explanation 2: Treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. AlpelisibFulvestrant e ∧ Prolonged e ProgressionFreeSurvival ∧ Patient x ∧ PIK3CAmutated x ∧ HRpositive x ∧ HER2negative x ∧ AdvancedBreastCancer x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x"

(* Explanation 3: A patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Patient x ⟶ LessSensitive x Chemotherapy"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
 shows "∃e. BenefitFromTreatment e ∧ Target e PIK3CAmutated"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has received endocrine therapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" and "ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(B, C), which states that treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously implies that the patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  (* This implies that if a patient benefits from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant, they are likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  
  (* We also have the derived implication Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), which states that if the patient is not likely less sensitive to chemotherapy, then using a kinase inhibitor may not target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
  (* Therefore, if a patient benefits from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant, they are likely sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  
  (* Combining the above two implications, we can infer that if a patient benefits from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant, using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
  
  (* This aligns with the logical proposition A: using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
  
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an event e where the patient benefits from treatment and the target is PIK3CA mutated. *)
  then have "∃e. BenefitFromTreatment e ∧ Target e PIK3CAmutated" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
