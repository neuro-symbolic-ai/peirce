(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x ∧ Agent x y ∧ Patient y"

(* Explanation 2: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ Effective e ∧ Treat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient x y ∧ With e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient y exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(activating mutation in CTNNB1, Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations) *)
  (* Since the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, a Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ In e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
