(* Explanation 1: Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ MetastaticBreastCancer y"

(* Explanation 2: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. PIK3CA x ⟶ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x BreastCancer"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ In x y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about the patient, activating mutation, PIK3CA, and seen frequently. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ SeenFrequently z ∧ In z BreastCancer" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer, PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have Patient x, ActivatingMutation y, PIK3CA y, and SeenFrequently z. *)
  (* From the logical relation, we can infer In z BreastCancer. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ In z BreastCancer ∧ SeenFrequently z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
