(* Explanation 1: The mutation of CTNNB1 leads to the activation of events that promote cell proliferation via β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. MutationOfCTNNB1 x ∧ ActivationOfEvents y ∧ Leads e1 ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Activation e2 ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Promote e2 ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Via e2 z ∧ BetaCatenin z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MutationOfCTNNB1 x ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutations x e ∧ ProliferationOfCells y"
  (* Hypothesis: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MutationOfCTNNB1 x ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutations x e ∧ ProliferationOfCells y ∧ Promote e ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ BetaCatenin z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the mutation of CTNNB1, activation, mutations, and proliferation of cells. *)
  from asm have "MutationOfCTNNB1 x ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutations x e ∧ ProliferationOfCells y" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating that the mutation of CTNNB1 leads to the activation of events that promote cell proliferation via β-catenin. *)
  (* This can be represented as Implies(A, B), where A is the mutation of CTNNB1 and B is the activation of events that promote cell proliferation via β-catenin. *)
  (* We can infer the promotion of events and the involvement of β-catenin based on the explanatory sentence. *)
  then have "MutationOfCTNNB1 x ∧ Activating e ∧ Mutations x e ∧ ProliferationOfCells y ∧ Promote e ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ BetaCatenin z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
