(* Explanation 1: YAP cooperates with β-catenin to induce Hepatoblastoma development. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. YAP x ∧ βCatenin y ∧ HepatoblastomaDevelopment e ∧ Induce e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: YAP suppression reduces β-catenin levels and inhibits β-catenin dependent growth. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. YAPSuppression x ∧ βCateninLevels y ∧ βCateninDependentGrowth z ∧ Reduces e1 ∧ Inhibits e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x y. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ Effective e ∧ May e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about YAPInhibitor and βCateninActivity. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by simp
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that YAP cooperates with β-catenin to induce Hepatoblastoma development. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that YAP suppression reduces β-catenin levels and inhibits β-catenin dependent growth. *)
  (* We can infer that YAPInhibitor x is related to YAP suppression and may inhibit β-catenin activity. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that a YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  then have "∃x y. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ Effective e ∧ May e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
