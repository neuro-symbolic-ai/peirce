(* Explanation 1: If an entity has an activating PIK3Ca mutation and is a patient, then the entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Entity x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Patient z ⟶ (Known x ∧ Located x BreastCancerTissue)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. ActivatingMutation x ∧ PIK3Ca x ∧ Patient y ⟶ (Known y ∧ Located y BreastCancerTissue)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn y BreastCancerTissue"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y" by auto
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that if there is an activating PIK3Ca mutation in a patient, then the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* This aligns with the hypothesis that the patient is seen frequently in breast cancer tissue. *)
  then have "Known x ∧ Located x BreastCancerTissue" using explanation_2 by blast
  (* We can infer that the patient is seen frequently in breast cancer tissue. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
