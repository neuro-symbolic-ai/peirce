(* Explanation 1: The activating mutation in CTNNB1 is specifically caused by the mutation W25_H36del *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x CTNNB1 ∧ CausedBy y x ∧ Mutation y ∧ W25_H36del y"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient implies the presence of the activating mutation in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Hepatoblastoma x ∧ Patient y ∧ In x y ⟶ (∃z. ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1)"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that implies the presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient leads to the activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient, activating mutation in CTNNB1) *)
  (* We can infer that the presence of hepatoblastoma in the patient x implies the activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then have "∃z. ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1" <ATP>
  then obtain z where "ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a patient x with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
