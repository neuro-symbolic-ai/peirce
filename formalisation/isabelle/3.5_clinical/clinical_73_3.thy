(* Explanation 1: For any entity with the PIK3CA mutation, if it is a frequent activating mutation in breast cancer, then it is also known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Entity x ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ With x y ∧ FrequentActivation y BreastCancer ⟶ (Known x BreastCancer ∧ Located x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of the PIK3CA mutation in an entity implies that it is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Presence x y ∧ In x BreastCancer ⟶ (Known x BreastCancer ∧ Located x BreastCancer)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn z BreastCancer"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn z BreastCancer ∧ Has x y ∧ In x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the patient, activating mutation, PIK3CA mutation, and seen frequently in breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" and "ActivatingMutation y" and "PIK3CA y" and "SeenFrequentlyIn z BreastCancer" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(entity has the PIK3CA mutation, entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue) *)
  (* We have PIK3CA y from the premise, so we can infer Known x BreastCancer and Located x BreastCancer from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  then have "Known x BreastCancer" and "Located x BreastCancer" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* We can combine the extracted information with the inferred information to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn z BreastCancer ∧ Has x y ∧ In x z" apply (simp add: assms)
