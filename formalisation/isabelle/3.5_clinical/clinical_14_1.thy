(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair specifically in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ Humans y ⟶ (InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ SpecificallyIn x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"
 (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ InHumans x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We also know that repair molecules are undamaged and homologous. *)
  (* From the known information, we can infer that BRCA2 x and RepairMolecules y are true. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RepairMolecules y" and "Undamaged y" and "Homologous y" apply meson
  
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair specifically in humans. *)
  (* This implies that if BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair, it is specifically in humans. *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer that it is specifically in humans. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹BRCA2 x› have "SpecificallyIn x y" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We need to show that BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  (* We already have BRCA2 x, RepairMolecules y, Undamaged y, and Homologous y. *)
  (* We also need to show Joining e, Agent e x, Patient e y, Via e z, RAD51Homolog1 z, and InHumans x. *)
  (* We can use the information that SpecificallyIn x y to infer InHumans x. *)
  then have "InHumans x" using assms apply auto[1]
  
  (* We have successfully shown all the required conditions for the hypothesis. *)
