(* Explanation 1: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathogenic y ∧ In x y PALB2"

(* Explanation 2: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ Sites e ∧ DNA e ∧ Damage e ∧ Links e ∧ BRCA1 e ∧ HRRepair e ∧ DNA e ∧ Damage e"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ Promotes e ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ Homologous e ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Humans z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
 shows "∃e x y. Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ In e HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about Loss, PALB2, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Loss e" and "PALB2 x" and "BRCA2 y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2, BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans) *)
  (* Both A and C are from explanatory sentences 1 and 3. *)
  (* We already have BRCA2 y, so we can infer BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  then have "BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans" <ATP>
  (* We need to show the existence of e, x, and y satisfying the required conditions. *)
  (* We can combine the known information and the derived implication to reach the conclusion. *)
  then have "∃e x y. Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ RepairMolecules e ∧ Undamaged e ∧ In e HRR" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
