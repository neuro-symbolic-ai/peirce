(* Explanation 1: If a patient has hepatoblastoma, then there exists a related entity with an activating mutation in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ⟶ (∃w. RelatedEntity w x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In w z ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ DirectlyLinked x y)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient implies the presence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ⟶ (∃w. RelatedEntity w x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In w z ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ DirectlyLinked x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is related to hepatoblastoma. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have the explanatory sentences that connect patient having hepatoblastoma to an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations and the given explanations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(patient has hepatoblastoma, there exists a related entity with an activating mutation in CTNNB1) *)
  (* Both A and B are from the explanatory sentences. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an activating mutation in CTNNB1 related to the patient x. *)
  then have "∃y. ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
