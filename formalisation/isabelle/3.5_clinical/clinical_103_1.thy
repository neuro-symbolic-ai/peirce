(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain is expected to be an effective drug for breast cancer patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Inhibitor e ∧ Targeted e HER2KinaseDomain ∧ Effective e ∧ BreastCancerPatient e ⟶ Expected e"

(* Explanation 2: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e. Targeting e HERV777LMutation ∧ Inhibitor e ∧ Irreversible e ∧ OvercomeResistance e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitor(e) ∧ Targeted e HER2KinaseDomain ∧ OvercomeResistance e ∧ Effective e ∧ BreastCancerPatient e"
  (* Hypothesis: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain may overcome treatment resistance and be effective in breast cancer patients. *)
