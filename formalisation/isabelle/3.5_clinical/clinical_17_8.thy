(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x ∧ TumorSuppressor x ⟶ Human x"

(* Explanation 2: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a tumor suppressor, then it is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x ∧ TumorSuppressor x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"

(* Explanation 3: For all entities x, if BRCA2 protein is a human protein and a tumor suppressor, then it is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x ∧ Human x ∧ TumorSuppressor x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x"
 (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
 shows "Human x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x and Protein x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x" by simp
  (* We have the logical relations Implies(A, B), Implies(A, C), and Implies(And(B, A), C). *)
  (* We can use these relations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* From Implies(A, B), we can infer Human x. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x› have "Human x" sledgehammer
  (* From Implies(A, C), we can infer InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹BRCA2 x ∧ Protein x› have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have proven the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
