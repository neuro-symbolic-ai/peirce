(* Explanation 1: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cell z ∧ βCatenin e ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Means e y ∧ Via e z"

(* Explanation 2: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCatenin y ∧ Effective e ∧ In e x ∧ Inhibit e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 z ∧ Effective e ∧ In e x ∧ Means e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
  (* We can infer that the activating mutations of CTNNB1 lead to promoting proliferation of cells. *)
  then have "Proliferation z ∧ Cell w ∧ βCatenin v ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Means e z ∧ Via e w" for z w v e <ATP>
  (* There is no direct relation between the known information and the hypothesis. *)
  (* However, there is another explanatory sentence stating that a YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  (* We can use this to connect the known information to the hypothesis. *)
  then obtain a b c where "YAPInhibitor a ∧ βCatenin b ∧ Effective c ∧ In c a ∧ Inhibit c b" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the information about the YAP inhibitor with the known information and the inferred information to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor a ∧ Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutationCTNNB1 y ∧ Effective c ∧ In c a ∧ Means c x ∧ Via c y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
