(* Explanation 1: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BRAF x ∧ (MAPK/ERK) y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Plays e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ ThroughRegulationOf x y"

(* Explanation 2: A BRAF mutation is a spontaneous change in the BRAF gene that causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. BRAFMutation x ∧ BRAFGene y ∧ Protein z ∧ SpontaneousChange e1 ∧ Causes e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ TurnOn e2 ∧ KeepOn e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "MutationInBRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation and secretion. *)
  shows "∃x y e. MutationInBRAF x ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ∧ Affects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the mutation in BRAF. *)
  from asm have "MutationInBRAF x" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentence 2 stating the relationship between BRAF mutation and the BRAF gene turning on the protein and keeping it on. *)
  (* This implies that the mutation in BRAF affects the protein and keeps it on. *)
  then have "∃z e2. Protein z ∧ KeepOn e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z" <ATP>
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we know that BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion through its regulation of MAPK/ERK. *)
  (* This implies that the mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "∃y. CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y" <ATP>
  (* Combining the effects on the protein and the cell processes, we can conclude that a mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
