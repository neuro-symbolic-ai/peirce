(* Explanation 1: The interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors licensed for use in prostate cancer patients implies that the patient has two potential treatment options. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1. Olaparib x ∧ Rucaparib y ∧ PARP1Inhibitor z ∧ ProstateCancerPatient w ∧ Implies e1 ∧ Patient w ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient z"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ Patient z ∧ For z y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is z. *)
  from asm have "Patient z" by simp
  (* The hypothesis is related to the logical proposition B, which is derived from the explanation sentence. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors licensed for use in prostate cancer patients, patient has two potential treatment options) *)
  (* Since the patient z is related to the interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors, we can infer that there are two potential treatment options for this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ Patient z" using explanation_1 by blast
