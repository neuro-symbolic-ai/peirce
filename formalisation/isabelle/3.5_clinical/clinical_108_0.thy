(* Explanation 1: With the development of a humanized monoclononal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, trastuzumab, the prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients has dramatically improved *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Prognosis x ∧ Improved e ∧ Dramatically e ∧ For e z ∧ HER2 z ∧ BreastCancerPatients z ∧ Develop e ∧ HumanizedMonoclonalAntibody y ∧ Target y z ∧ Trastuzumab y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Mutated y (V777L_HER2) ∧ Amplified y (HER2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ BenefitFrom e ∧ Treatment e y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There are logical relations between the patient's conditions and the effects of the treatment. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(patient has V777L HER2 mutated breast cancer, patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentence 2, we can infer that the patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ BenefitFrom e ∧ Treatment e y ∧ With x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
