(* Explanation 1: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e ∧ May e ∧ Agent e x y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257 Is a TTK inhibitor in phase 1 studies in patients with Breast cancer and advanced solid tumours *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. CFI_402257 x ∧ TTKInhibitor y ∧ Phase1Study e ∧ In e ∧ Patient y ∧ With e BreastCancer ∧ With e AdvancedSolidTumours"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
  shows "∃x y e. CFI_402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor e ∧ May e ∧ Agent e x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about TTK Inhibitor and the patient. *)
  from asm have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that a TTK Inhibitor may be effective in a patient. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition A. *)
  (* We can use this information to infer that the TTK Inhibitor x may be effective in the patient y. *)
  then obtain e where "Effective e ∧ May e ∧ Agent e x y" sledgehammer
  (* Now, we know that the TTK Inhibitor y is CFI-402257 and it is in phase 1 studies with specific conditions. *)
  (* This information is captured in the explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Since the TTK Inhibitor x is CFI-402257, we can conclude that CFI-402257 may be suitable for the patient y. *)
  then obtain e' where "CFI_402257 x ∧ Phase1Study e' ∧ In e' ∧ Patient y ∧ With e' BreastCancer ∧ With e' AdvancedSolidTumours" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that there exists x, y, and e such that CFI-402257 x may be suitable for the patient y. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
