(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. BRCA2Loss e ∧ LeadTo e (PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMoleculesHomologousRecombinationRepair e)"

(* Explanation 2: The prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules is a consequence of the loss of BRCA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules e ⟶ ConsequenceOf e (BRCA2Loss e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2Loss e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "∃e. BRCA2Loss e ∧ PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules e ∧ JoinUndamagedRepairMolecules e ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2Loss e" by simp
  (* The loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We can infer the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain e where "BRCA2Loss e ∧ LeadTo e (PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMoleculesHomologousRecombinationRepair e)" by blast
  then have "PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMoleculesHomologousRecombinationRepair e" sledgehammer
  (* The prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules is a consequence of the loss of BRCA. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules is a consequence of the loss of BRCA. *)
  (* We can infer the consequence of the loss of BRCA. *)
  from explanation_2 have "ConsequenceOf e (BRCA2Loss e)" by auto
  (* Since the loss of BRCA2 leads to the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair, and the prevention of joining undamaged repair molecules is a consequence of the loss of BRCA, we can conclude that the loss of BRCA2 prevents the joining of undamaged repair molecules in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "BRCA2Loss e ∧ PreventJoiningUndamagedRepairMolecules e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
