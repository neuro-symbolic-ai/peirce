(* Explanation 1: The patient does not have a BRCA mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BRCA y ∧ ¬Have e y ∧ Mutation y"

(* Explanation 2: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib y ∧ Licensed z ∧ PARPInhibitors z ∧ ForTreatment z ∧ Patient x ∧ BRCAmutated x ∧ HER2negative x ∧ AdvancedOrMetastaticBC x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬Appropriate e ∧ For x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is associated with PARP inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* We have the explanation that the patient does not have a BRCA mutation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(A), Not(B)), Implies(Not(Patient has BRCA mutation), Not(Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC)) *)
  (* Since the patient does not have a BRCA mutation, Olaparib and talazoparib are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  then have "¬Appropriate e" sledgehammer
  (* We also have the information that Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC. *)
  (* Therefore, for this patient, PARP inhibitors are not appropriate. *)
  then have "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬Appropriate e ∧ For x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
