(* Explanation 1: For any recipient of the unavailable event and any patient, if the recipient is the patient, then the event is for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Recipient e x ∧ Patient y ⟶ (Recipient e y ⟶ For e y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Recipient e z"
 (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Patient z ∧ Unavailable e ∧ Recipient e z ∧ Of e x ∧ Of e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the recipient. *)
  from asm have "Recipient e z" by simp
  (* We know from the explanatory sentence that if the recipient is the patient, then the event is for that patient. *)
  (* This implies that if the recipient is the patient, then the event is for the patient. *)
  (* Since the recipient is z, we can infer that the event is for z. *)
  then have "Recipient e z ⟶ For e z" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show the existence of Vemurafenib, MEKInhibitor, Patient, Unavailable, and Of x and y. *)
  (* We can introduce these existentially quantified variables. *)
