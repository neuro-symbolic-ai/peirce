(* Explanation 1: SS breaks trigger HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y. SSBreaks x ∧ HRR y ⟶ Triggers e x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB *)
 shows "∃e. CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DSB e ∧ ResultsIn e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that InhibitionOfPARP x is true. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that states SS breaks trigger HRR. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition A and B. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(SS breaks, HRR) *)
  (* Since we have InhibitionOfPARP x and the relation Implies(A, B), we can infer HRR. *)
  then have "HRR y" for y sledgehammer
  (* Now, we can construct the desired result by introducing a new event e. *)
  then have "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DSB e ∧ ResultsIn e x" for e <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
