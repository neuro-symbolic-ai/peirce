(* Explanation 1: If an entity has the PIK3CA mutation and is a patient, then it is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Entity x ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ Has x y ∧ Patient x ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of the PIK3CA mutation in a patient implies that the patient is known and located in the breast cancer tissue *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PIK3CA y ∧ Patient x ⟶ (Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn z BreastCancer ∧ Has x y ∧ In x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the entity x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have the explanatory sentences that relate the PIK3CA mutation, patient, known, and located in breast cancer tissue. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, entity is known and located in the breast cancer tissue) *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentences to infer that the patient x is known and located in the breast cancer tissue. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "Known x ∧ LocatedIn x BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  (* We can then introduce the necessary variables for the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ SeenFrequentlyIn z BreastCancer ∧ Has x y ∧ In x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
