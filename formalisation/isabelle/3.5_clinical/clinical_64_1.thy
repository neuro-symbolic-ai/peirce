(* Explanation Sentence: A kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_sentence: "∃x y z e. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutations y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ In e y z ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Proliferation e ∧ Survival e"

(* Premise Sentence: Treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. *)
axiomatization where
  premise_sentence: "∃x y z e. Treatment x ∧ ProgressionFreeSurvival y ∧ Patients z ∧ PIK3CAMutated z ∧ HRPositive z ∧ HER2Negative z ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy z ∧ Previously z ∧ Prolonged e ∧ Among e y z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy x"
  (* Hypothesis: A patient has previously received endocrine therapy. *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Therapy e y ∧ Previously e"
