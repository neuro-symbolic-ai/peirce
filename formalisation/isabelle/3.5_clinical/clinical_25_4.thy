(* Explanation 1: The specific event of EffectiveInhibiting e leads to the Inhibition of e. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. EffectiveInhibiting e ⟶ Inhibition e"

(* Explanation 2: If a YAP inhibitor is effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, then it results in the event of EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ⟶ EffectiveInhibiting e"

(* Explanation 3: The Agent of the event e is the YAP inhibitor x. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Agent e x"

(* Explanation 4: The Patient of the event e is the β-catenin activity y. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀y e. βCateninActivity y ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that a YAP inhibitor x and β-catenin activity y are involved. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(YAP inhibitor is effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity, EffectiveInhibiting e) *)
  (* Using this relation and the premise, we can infer EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
  from asm and explanation_2 have "EffectiveInhibiting e" sledgehammer
  (* From EffectiveInhibiting e, we can derive the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(EffectiveInhibiting e, Inhibition of e) *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer Inhibition of e. *)
  from calculation and explanation_1 have "Inhibition e" <ATP>
  (* We also have the information from explanatory sentences 3 and 4 that the Agent of the event e is the YAP inhibitor x and the Patient of the event e is the β-catenin activity y. *)
  from asm and explanation_3 and explanation_4 have "Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* Finally, combining all the inferred information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
