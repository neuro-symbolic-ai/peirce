(* Explanation 1: Introducing a new explanatory sentence to explicitly state that the activation of mutations of CTNNB1 leads to the promotion of cell proliferation via β-catenin *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. ExplanatorySentence x ∧ State e ∧ Explicitly e ∧ Activate e CTNNB1 ∧ Promote e ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cell y ∧ Via e z ∧ BetaCatenin z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "CTNNB1 x ∧ Mutation e"
  (* Hypothesis: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin *)
 shows "∃x y z e. CTNNB1 x ∧ Mutation e ∧ Activate e x ∧ Promote e ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cell y ∧ Via e z ∧ BetaCatenin z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that CTNNB1 is activated and there is a mutation. *)
  from asm have "CTNNB1 x" and "Mutation e" apply simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the activation of mutations of CTNNB1 leads to the promotion of cell proliferation via β-catenin. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(activation of mutations of CTNNB1, promotion of cell proliferation) *)
  (* There is also a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(activation of mutations of CTNNB1, β-catenin) *)
  (* We can combine these relations with the known information to derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Activate e x" and "Promote e" and "Proliferation y" and "Cell y" and "Via e z" and "BetaCatenin z" by (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
