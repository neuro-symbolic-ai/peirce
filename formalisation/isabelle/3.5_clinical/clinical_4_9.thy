(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly leading to chromosome breakage implies that there is a causal relationship between the loss of BRCA2 and chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ Directly e1 ∧ LeadTo e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2 ∧ CausalRelationship e1 e2"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 being a direct cause of chromosome breakage indicates a direct causal link between the loss of BRCA2 and the occurrence of chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ DirectCause e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2 ∧ DirectCausalLink e1 e2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2(e)"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
  shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2(e) ∧ Cause(e) ∧ ChromosomeBreakage(e)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2(e)" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 which provide information about the causal relationships. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2 directly leading to chromosome breakage, there is a causal relationship between the loss of BRCA2 and chromosome breakage) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(Loss of BRCA2 being a direct cause of chromosome breakage, a direct causal link between the loss of BRCA2 and the occurrence of chromosome breakage) *)
  (* Both A and C are related to the hypothesis we want to prove. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we can infer a causal relationship between the loss of BRCA2 and chromosome breakage. *)
  then obtain e1 e2 where "LossOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ Directly e1 ∧ LeadTo e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2 ∧ CausalRelationship e1 e2" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we can infer a direct causal link between the loss of BRCA2 and the occurrence of chromosome breakage. *)
  then obtain e1 e2 where "LossOfBRCA2 e1 ∧ DirectCause e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2 ∧ DirectCausalLink e1 e2" using explanation_2 by blast
  (* Combining the causal relationship and the direct causal link, we can conclude that the loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage. *)
