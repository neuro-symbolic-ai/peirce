(* Explanation 1: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localization to specific sites within the cell *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ RequiredFor e ∧ Localization e ∧ SpecificSitesWithinCell z ∧ At x z ∧ At y z"

(* Explanation 2: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 plays a crucial role in facilitating the intracellular movement of BRCA2 to sites where DNA damage occurs *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. BindingPartner x ∧ EncodedBy x PALB2 ∧ CrucialRole y ∧ Facilitating e ∧ IntracellularMovement e ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ SitesOfDNADamage z ∧ At x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localization to sites of DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ RequiredFor e ∧ Localization e ∧ At x z ∧ At y z ∧ SitesOfDNADamage z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about PALB2 and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x" and "BRCA2 z" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, C), which states that if PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2, it is required for its localization to specific sites within the cell. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we can infer the required localization. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain y e where "BindingPartner y" and "RequiredFor e" and "Localization e" and "SpecificSitesWithinCell z" and "At x z" and "At y z" by auto
  
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(A, B), which states that if PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2, the binding partner plays a crucial role in facilitating the intracellular movement of BRCA2 to sites where DNA damage occurs. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we can infer the crucial role, facilitating, intracellular movement, and sites of DNA damage. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain e' where "CrucialRole y" and "Facilitating e'" and "IntracellularMovement e'" and "SitesOfDNADamage z" and "At x z" by auto
  
  (* Combining the information from both explanations, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ RequiredFor e ∧ Localization e ∧ At x z ∧ At y z ∧ SitesOfDNADamage z" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
