(* Explanation 1: Patient now has progressive disease *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ HasProgressiveDisease x"

(* Explanation 2: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ StableDisease y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e ∧ Object e x ∧ After e x"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ HasProgressiveDisease x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
  shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Consider e ∧ Object e x ∧ After e x ∧ SecondLineTreatment x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a progressive disease. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ HasProgressiveDisease x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy, Patient now has progressive disease) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ StableDisease y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e ∧ Object e x ∧ After e x" for y z e sledgehammer
  (* We aim to show that the patient should be considered for second-line treatment. *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient should be considered for second-line treatment. *)
