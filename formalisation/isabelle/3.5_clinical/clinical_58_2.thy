(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Humans e ⟶ (InvolvedInHRR x e ∧ InvolvedInHRR y e)"

(* Explanation 2: The binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Binding z ∧ Catalyzes e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining z ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Humans e"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
  shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e (RAD51Homolog1) ∧ InHumans e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that humans are involved. *)
  from asm have "Humans e" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition A from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR in humans, The binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentences 1 and 2. *)
  (* We can infer the hypothesis from B. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e (RAD51Homolog1) ∧ InHumans e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
