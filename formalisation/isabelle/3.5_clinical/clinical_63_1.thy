(* Explanation 1: HRR is the primary process for repairing DNA double strand breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. HRR x ⟶ PrimaryProcess x ∧ Repairing x DNADoubleStrandBreaks"

(* Explanation 2: HRR repairs damage to DNA using information copied from a homologous undamaged molecule *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. HRR x ∧ DamageToDNA y ∧ HomologousUndamagedMolecule z ∧ CopiedInformation z ⟶ Repairs x y ∧ Using x z"

(* Explanation 3: Undamaged homologous molecules are provided by sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. UndamagedHomologousMolecules x ⟶ (SisterChromatids x ∨ PaternalMaternalCopies x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HRR x"
  (* Hypothesis: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "PrimaryProcess x ∧ (∃y z. DamageToDNA y ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ From y z ∧ (SisterChromatids z ∨ PaternalMaternalCopies z))"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that HRR x. *)
  from asm have "HRR x" by simp
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(HRR is the primary process for repairing DNA double strand breaks, HRR repairs damage to DNA using information copied from a homologous undamaged molecule) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer that HRR x repairs damage to DNA using information copied from a homologous undamaged molecule. *)
  then have "Repairs x DNADoubleStrandBreaks ∧ (∃y z. DamageToDNA y ∧ HomologousUndamagedMolecule z ∧ Using x z)" sledgehammer
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(HRR repairs damage to DNA using information copied from a homologous undamaged molecule, Undamaged homologous molecules are provided by sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes) *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 2, C is from explanatory sentence 3. *)
  (* We can infer that undamaged homologous molecules are provided by sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  then have "UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ (SisterChromatids z ∨ PaternalMaternalCopies z)" for z <ATP>
  
  (* Since HRR x is the primary process for repairing DNA double strand breaks, and undamaged homologous molecules are provided by sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
