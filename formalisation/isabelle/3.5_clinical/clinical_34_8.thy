(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation, then the mutation is specifically located in CTNNB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ⟶ Located y CTNNB ∧ In y CTNNB"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y"
 (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ Located y CTNNB"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has an activating mutation y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(patient has an activating mutation, mutation is specifically located in CTNNB) *)
  (* We can use the known information to infer that the mutation y is specifically located in CTNNB. *)
  then have "Located y CTNNB" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Since the mutation y is specifically located in CTNNB, we can infer that it is in CTNNB. *)
  then have "In y CTNNB" using assms explanation_1 by blast
  (* Combining the information about the patient x and the activating mutation y, we can conclude the desired result. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ Located y CTNNB" sledgehammer
