(* Explanation 1: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ RequiredFor e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ LocalisationTo e ∧ LocalisationToSitesOf e DNA_damage"

(* Explanation 2: PALB2 encodes a major BRCA2 binding partner that links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ Major y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Links e ∧ LinksWith e BRCA1 ∧ LinksWith e BRCA2 ∧ In e HR_repair ∧ In e DNA_damage"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ LocalisationTo e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ At x DNA_damage ∧ Links e ∧ LinksWith e BRCA1 ∧ LinksWith e BRCA2 ∧ In e HR_repair ∧ In e DNA_damage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about PALB2, BindingPartner, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z" <ATP>
  (* We know from Explanation 1 that PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localization to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2, PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer that PALB2 is required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  then have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ LocalisationTo e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ At x DNA_damage" <ATP>
  (* We also know from Explanation 2 that PALB2 encodes a major BRCA2 binding partner that links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(PALB2 encodes a major BRCA2 binding partner, PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer that PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage. *)
  then have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ LocalisationTo e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ At x DNA_damage ∧ Links e ∧ LinksWith e BRCA1 ∧ LinksWith e BRCA2 ∧ In e HR_repair ∧ In e DNA_damage" <ATP>
