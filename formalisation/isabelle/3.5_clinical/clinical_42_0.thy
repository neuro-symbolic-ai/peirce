(* Explanation 1: NCT03568656 targets CREBBP *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ CREBBP y ∧ Targets x y"

(* Explanation 2: CREBBP potential role in cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CREBBP x ⟶ PotentialRoleInCancer x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ⟶ RelevantFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that NCT03568656 targets CREBBP and the patient is relevant. *)
  from asm have "NCT03568656 x" and "Patient y" apply simp
  
  (* We have the information that NCT03568656 targets CREBBP from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  then obtain a b where "NCT03568656 a ∧ CREBBP b ∧ Targets a b" by (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We also know that CREBBP has a potential role in cancer from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  from ‹CREBBP b› have "PotentialRoleInCancer b" sledgehammer
  
  (* Since the patient is relevant and CREBBP has a potential role in cancer, NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient. *)
  then have "RelevantFor a y" <ATP>
  
  (* Therefore, we have shown that there exists x and y such that NCT03568656 x and Patient y imply RelevantFor x y. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
