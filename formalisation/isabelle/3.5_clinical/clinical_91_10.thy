(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is related to the manner in which e acts *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. RecoveryProcess e ⟶ (∃x. Agent x e ∧ (∃y. Involving e y ∧ PARP12Inhibitors y) ⟶ (∃z. Manner z ∧ RelatedTo e z)"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the recovery process is dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. RecoveryProcess e ⟶ (∃x. Agent x e ∧ (∃y. Involving e y ∧ PARP12Inhibitors y) ⟶ (∃z. Role z y ∧ DNARepair z (DependentOn e z))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors x ∧ TumourSpecificDefects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitors x ∧ TumourSpecificDefects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y ∧ Role y (RecoverFrom z)"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Inhibitors x, TumourSpecificDefects y, and DNARepair z. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x" and "TumourSpecificDefects y" and "DNARepair z" <ATP>
  (* We know that the recovery process is related to the manner in which the agent acts and dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair. *)
  (* These are from the explanation sentences. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, the recovery process is related to the manner in which e acts) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, the recovery process is dependent on the role of PARP1 in DNA repair) *)
  (* We can infer the existence of an agent e, a target e, and a through relation y based on the known information. *)
  then have "∃e. Agent e x ∧ Through e y" <ATP>
  (* We can also infer the existence of a role y related to the recovery from z. *)
  then have "∃y. Role y (RecoverFrom z)" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the inferred information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
