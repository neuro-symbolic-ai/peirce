(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 loss drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. BRCA2Loss e ∧ Drives e ∧ CancerDevelopment e ∧ Via e e GenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2Loss e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃e. BRCA2Loss e ∧ Drives e ∧ CancerDevelopment e ∧ Via e e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about BRCA2 loss. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2Loss e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(BRCA2 loss, genomic instability) *)
  (* We can infer genomic instability from BRCA2 loss. *)
  then have "GenomicInstability e" <ATP>
  (* From the explanatory sentence, we have BRCA2 loss driving cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  (* This implies BRCA2 loss drives cancer development. *)
  then have "BRCA2Loss e ∧ Drives e ∧ CancerDevelopment e ∧ Via e e GenomicInstability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
