(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Humans e ⟶ (InvolvedInHRR x e ∧ InvolvedInHRR y e)"

(* Explanation 2: The binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Binding z ∧ Catalyzes e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ Patient e z"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
  shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e (RAD51Homolog1) ∧ InHumans e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 is related to repair molecules, undamaged molecules, and homologous molecules. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RepairMolecules y" and "Undamaged y" and "Homologous y" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the logical proposition A: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR in humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), which states that if BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR in humans, then the binding of them catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  (* We can use this relation to infer the joining of undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "InvolvedInHRR x e" and "InvolvedInHRR (RAD51Homolog1) e" <ATP>
  from explanation_2 and `InvolvedInHRR x e` and `InvolvedInHRR (RAD51Homolog1) e` obtain "Joining e" <ATP>
  
  (* We also know that BRCA2 is the agent and repair molecules are the patient in the event. *)
  from asm have "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" <ATP>
  
  (* Additionally, we can infer that the event is in humans. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "Humans e" <ATP>
  
  (* Finally, we can conclude the hypothesis by combining all the inferred information. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
