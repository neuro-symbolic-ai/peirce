(* Explanation 1: Genomic instability can drive cancer development *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. GenomicInstability e ∧ Drive e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity exhibits genomic instability, it can lead to cancer development *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e1 e2. Entity x ∧ Exhibits e1 x GenomicInstability ⟶ (Lead e2 ∧ Patient e2 CancerDevelopment)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Entity x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃e. LossBRCA2 e ∧ Drive e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Entity x is given. *)
  from asm have "Entity x" <ATP>
  (* We have Explanation 2 stating that if an entity exhibits genomic instability, it can lead to cancer development. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Genomic instability, lead to cancer development) *)
  (* We can infer that if an entity exhibits genomic instability, it can lead to cancer development. *)
  then have "∃e. Exhibits e x GenomicInstability ∧ Lead e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 1 states that genomic instability can drive cancer development. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Genomic instability, drive cancer development) *)
  (* We can conclude that genomic instability can drive cancer development. *)
  then obtain e where "GenomicInstability e ∧ Drive e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment" <ATP>
  (* We need to show that the loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  (* We can introduce the necessary conditions to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then have "LossBRCA2 e ∧ Drive e ∧ Patient e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
