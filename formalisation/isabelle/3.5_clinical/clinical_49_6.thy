(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor in driving cancer development through a specific event e. The event e2, where loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor, involves both driving cancer development and genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e1 ∧ Factor e1 ∧ Drive e1 ∧ CancerDevelopment e1 ∧ Through e1 e2 ∧ SpecificEvent e2 ∧ Factor e2 ∧ Involves e2 Drive ∧ Involves e2 GenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e ∧ Drive e ∧ CancerDevelopment e ∧ Through e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e holds. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e" <ATP>
  (* Given the logical proposition Implies(A, B), we can infer that Loss of BRCA2 gene function being a factor in driving cancer development implies the event e2 involves both driving cancer development and genomic instability. *)
  (* This implies that Drive e, CancerDevelopment e, and Through e GenomicInstability hold for e2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can take e2 as the solution. *)
  then obtain e2 where "LossOfBRCA2GeneFunction e2 ∧ Drive e2 ∧ CancerDevelopment e2 ∧ Through e2 GenomicInstability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
