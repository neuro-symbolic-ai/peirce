(* Explanation 1: If an entity has the BRCA2 gene, it is related to genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. HasGene x BRCA2 ⟶ RelatedTo x GenomicInstability"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 gene mutation leads to genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e. Mutation e BRCA2Gene ∧ Leads e GenomicInstability"

(* Explanation 3: Loss of BRCA2 gene function results in genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃e. LossFunction e BRCA2Gene ∧ Results e GenomicInstability"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossBRCA2 e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
  shows "∃e. LossBRCA2 e ∧ Drive e CancerDevelopment ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about the loss of BRCA2 gene function. *)
  from asm have "LossBRCA2 e" by simp
  (* There are explanatory sentences related to the loss of BRCA2 gene function and genomic instability. *)
  (* We have Implies(D, B), Implies(loss of BRCA2 gene function, related to genomic instability) *)
  (* Both D and B are from the explanation sentences. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the relationship between loss of BRCA2 and genomic instability. *)
  then have "RelatedTo LossBRCA2 GenomicInstability" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis involves driving cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  (* We need to connect LossBRCA2 to Drive and Via. *)
  (* Since we have the relationship between LossBRCA2 and GenomicInstability, we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
