(* Explanation 3: A patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ LessSensitive e ∧ Likely e ∧ To e x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: A patient has previously received endocrine therapy. *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ EndocrineTherapy e ∧ Previously e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that a patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  from asm obtain y e where "Patient x ∧ LessSensitive e ∧ Likely e ∧ To e x" by sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival, patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient being less sensitive to chemotherapy is related to using a kinase inhibitor targeting mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway. *)
  then have "using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival" by <ATP>
  (* However, the hypothesis we aim to prove is about a patient who has previously received endocrine therapy. *)
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), Implies(Not(patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy), Not(using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival)) *)
  (* Since the patient is less sensitive to chemotherapy, it does not directly imply that they have received endocrine therapy. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot directly infer the hypothesis from the given information. *)
  (* The proof cannot be completed with the provided information. *)
