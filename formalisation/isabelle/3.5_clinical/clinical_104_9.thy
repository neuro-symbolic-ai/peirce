(* Explanation 1: Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. AdultSponges x ⟶ (∃e y z. Eggs y ∧ Sperm z ∧ Produce e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z)"

(* Explanation 2: Sperm and eggs are cells known as gametes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Sperm x ∧ Eggs y ⟶ Gametes x ∧ Gametes y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "True"
  shows "∃x y z e. HERMutation x ∧ TyrosineKinaseInhibitor y ∧ TreatmentResistance z ∧ Overcome e ∧ Target e x ∧ With e y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z"
proof -
  (* The HER2 V777L mutation is not directly related to trastuzumab resistance, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(HER2 V777L mutation located in the intracellular kinase domain, trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain) *)
  (* Since the mutation does not directly contribute to trastuzumab resistance, we can infer Not(B) from Not(A) *)
  have "¬TreatmentResistance z" if "HERMutation x" for x z sledgehammer
  
  (* If a specific mechanism is identified due to the HER2 V777L mutation, then a treatment targeting this mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, F), Implies(identify a specific mechanism, treatment targeting HER2 V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor) *)
  (* If a specific mechanism is identified, we can infer treatment resistance can be overcome. *)
  have "∃x y z e. HERMutation x ∧ TyrosineKinaseInhibitor y ∧ ¬TreatmentResistance z ∧ Overcome e ∧ Target e x ∧ With e y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z" if "D" for x y z e <ATP>
