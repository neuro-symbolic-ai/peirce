(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Purpose e x (TargetingDefects x)"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Manner e x (Recovery x)"

(* Explanation 3: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the role of PARP1/2 in the recovery from DNA damage is crucial *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e x. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ CrucialRole PARP12 (Recovery x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors e ∧ TargetingDefects e ∧ DNARepair e"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e. Inhibitors e ∧ Target e ∧ TumorSpecificDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ Role e PARP12 ∧ RecoverFromDamage e"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Inhibitors e, TargetingDefects e, and DNARepair e. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair) *)
  (* We can infer Purpose e x (TargetingDefects x) from the explanation 1. *)
  from asm and explanation_1 have "Purpose e TargetingDefects" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage) *)
  (* We can infer Manner e x (Recovery x) from the explanation 2. *)
  from asm and explanation_2 have "Manner e Recovery" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, the role of PARP1/2 in the recovery from DNA damage is crucial) *)
  (* We can infer CrucialRole PARP12 (Recovery x) from the explanation 3. *)
  from asm and explanation_3 have "CrucialRole PARP12 Recovery" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above inferences, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
