(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ HER2plus e"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Has x e ∧ Known e ∧ Mutation e V777LHER2"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Has x e ∧ Mutation e V777LHER2 ∧ HER2plus e ∧ BreastCancer e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There are two relevant explanation sentences: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer and Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation) *)
  (* Both A and B are from the explanation sentences. *)
  (* We can combine the information from both explanations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x1 e1 where "Patient x1 ∧ BreastCancer e1 ∧ HER2plus e1" by auto
  from explanation_2 obtain x2 e2 where "Patient x2 ∧ Has x2 e2 ∧ Known e2 ∧ Mutation e2 V777LHER2" by auto
  (* Combining the information from both explanations, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Patient x2 ∧ Has x2 e2 ∧ Mutation e2 V777LHER2 ∧ HER2plus e2 ∧ BreastCancer e2" by auto
