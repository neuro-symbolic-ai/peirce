(* Explanation 1: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1, and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x) ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that either x is BRCA2 or x is RAD51 homolog 1. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x" sledgehammer
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans) *)
  (* Since we have either BRCA2 x or RAD51Homolog1 x, and the involvement in homologous recombination repair is not explicitly given, we cannot directly infer InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot directly prove the hypothesis based on the given premise and explanation. *)
  (* Additional information or axioms are needed to establish the connection between BRCA2, RAD51 homolog 1, and involvement in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  (* Hence, the proof cannot be completed with the current information. *)
  (* This proof requires further details or axioms to establish the relationship between BRCA2, RAD51 homolog 1, and involvement in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
