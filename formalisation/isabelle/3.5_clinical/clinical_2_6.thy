(* Explanation 1: PARP1 inhibition leads to synthetic lethality in cells with defective homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ Inhibition e ∧ Leads e ∧ SyntheticLethality y ∧ In z Cells ∧ Defective z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z"

(* Explanation 2: Synthetic lethality causes cells to rely on a singular mechanism for repairing cumulative damage to DNA *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. SyntheticLethality x ∧ Cause e ∧ Cells y ∧ Rely e ∧ On y SingularMechanism ∧ Repairing e ∧ CumulativeDamage y DNA"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition e1 ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ May e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Cause e1 z ∧ Cells w ∧ Rely e1 ∧ On w SingularMechanism ∧ Repairing e1 ∧ CumulativeDamage w DNA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that patients have loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentences that connect PARP1 inhibition to synthetic lethality and synthetic lethality to relying on a singular mechanism for repairing cumulative damage to DNA. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PARP1 inhibition leads to synthetic lethality in cells with defective homologous recombination repair, cells with defective homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(synthetic lethality, cells rely on a singular mechanism for repairing cumulative damage to DNA) *)
  (* We can use these relations to infer the necessary components for the hypothesis. *)
  obtain a b c d where abcd: "PARP1 a ∧ Inhibition b ∧ Leads b ∧ SyntheticLethality c ∧ In d Cells ∧ Defective d ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair d ∧ SyntheticLethality a ∧ Cause b ∧ Cells d ∧ Rely b ∧ On d SingularMechanism ∧ Repairing b ∧ CumulativeDamage d DNA"
    <ATP>
  (* Now, we have all the required elements to prove the hypothesis. *)
  from abcd and asm show ?thesis <ATP>
