(* Explanation 1: The binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. BindingPartner x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ BRCA2 z ⟶ (SpecificallyRequiredFor x (Localization z) ∧ SitesOfDNA z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: PALB2 encodes a binding partner of BRCA2 that is required for its localisation to sites of DNA damage *)
 shows "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ Encodes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z ∧ SitesOfDNA z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about PALB2, BindingPartner, and BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z" by simp
  (* Using the explanatory sentence 1, we can infer that the binding partner encoded by PALB2 is specifically required for the localization of BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that the binding partner is required for the localization to sites of DNA damage. *)
  then have "SpecificallyRequiredFor y (Localization z) ∧ SitesOfDNA z" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* We can further break down the required components for the hypothesis. *)
  then have "PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ BRCA2 z ∧ Encodes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RequiredFor y z ∧ Localisation z ∧ SitesOfDNA z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
