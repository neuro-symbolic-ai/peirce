(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation x CTNNB ⟶ In y x ∧ CTNNB1Pathway y"

(* Explanation 2: For any patient who has an activating mutation in CTNNB and is in the CTNNB1 pathway, there exists a relationship where the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation x CTNNB ∧ In x z ∧ CTNNB1Pathway z ⟶ (∃e. In e x ∧ CTNNB1Pathway e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. Drug x ∧ Targeting x CTNNB ∧ Effective y ∧ Patient y ∧ In y x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient y exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" by simp
  (* We have the logical proposition A: a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway) *)
  (* We can use explanatory sentence 1 to infer that the patient y is in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Patient y› have "In y CTNNB ∧ CTNNB1Pathway y" sledgehammer
  (* We have the logical proposition B: the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway *)
  (* We can use explanatory sentence 2 to infer the existence of a relationship where the patient is in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹Patient y› and ‹In y CTNNB ∧ CTNNB1Pathway y› have "∃e. In e y ∧ CTNNB1Pathway e" <ATP>
  then obtain e where "In e y ∧ CTNNB1Pathway e" by auto
  (* We can conclude that there exists a drug x targeting CTNNB and it is effective in patient y. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
