(* Explanation 1: Being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase implies being a proto-oncogene *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. RASRegulated x ∧ Cytoplasmic x ∧ SerineThreonineKinase x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is a proto-oncogene, it plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. ProtoOncogene x ⟶ (∃e. PlayRoles e ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
 shows "ProtoOncogene x ∧ (∃e. PlayRoles e ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK)"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have BRAF x. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by simp
  (* We know that being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase implies being a proto-oncogene (A implies B). *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase, being a proto-oncogene) *)
  (* BRAF x is related to being a proto-oncogene. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that BRAF x is a proto-oncogene. *)
  then have "ProtoOncogene x" sledgehammer
  (* Now, we know that being a proto-oncogene implies playing important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (B implies C). *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(being a proto-oncogene, playing important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* Since BRAF x is a proto-oncogene, we can conclude that it plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "∃e. PlayRoles e ∧ Regulate e MAPK_ERK" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that BRAF x is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
