(* Explanation 1: Introducing the concept of "PI3KAKT z" is a result of the activation of Akt *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. PI3KAKT x ∧ Concept y ∧ ActivationOf y ∧ Akt x ⟶ ResultOf x y"

(* Explanation 2: The concept of "PI3KAKT z" leads to the identification of a target "e" that may inhibit the pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. PI3KAKT x ∧ Concept y ∧ Target e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Pathway z ∧ IdentificationOf y e ∧ MayInhibit e z"

(* Explanation 3: The agent "e" responsible for targeting the pathway is related to the entity "x" which represents the kinase inhibitor *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. Agent e x ∧ Pathway y ∧ RelatedTo e x ∧ Represents x ∧ KinaseInhibitor x"

(* Explanation 4: The patient "e" involved in the inhibition process is associated with the mutations "y" *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀e y. Patient e y ∧ InvolvedIn e ∧ InhibitionProcess e ∧ Mutations y ∧ AssociatedWith e y"

(* Explanation 5: The inhibition of the pathway by the target "e" results in the suppression of proliferation and survival in the cellular context *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e x y z. Inhibition e ∧ Pathway x ∧ Target e ∧ ResultIn e z ∧ Suppression z ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival z ∧ CellularContext z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z"
  (* Hypothesis: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival *)
  shows "∃x y z e. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RelatedTo e z ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that KinaseInhibitor x, Mutation y, Pathway z, and PI3KAKT z are true. *)
  from asm have "KinaseInhibitor x" and "Mutation y" and "Pathway z" and "PI3KAKT z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(Introducing the concept of "PI3KAKT z" is a result of the activation of Akt, The patient "e" involved in the inhibition process is associated with the mutations "y") *)
  (* Since we have PI3KAKT z, we can infer Patient e y. *)
  then have "Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(The patient "e" involved in the inhibition process is associated with the mutations "y", The inhibition of the pathway by the target "e" results in the suppression of proliferation and survival in the cellular context) *)
  (* With Patient e y, we can deduce the suppression of proliferation and survival in the cellular context. *)
  then have "Suppression z" and "Proliferation z" and "Survival z" and "CellularContext z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, C), Implies(The inhibition of the pathway by the target "e" results in the suppression of proliferation and survival in the cellular context, The agent "e" responsible for targeting the pathway is related to the entity "x" which represents the kinase inhibitor) *)
  (* Given the suppression and survival, we can conclude the relation between the agent e and the kinase inhibitor x. *)
  then have "Agent e x" and "RelatedTo e z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(The agent "e" responsible for targeting the pathway is related to the entity "x" which represents the kinase inhibitor, The concept of "PI3KAKT z" leads to the identification of a target "e" that may inhibit the pathway) *)
  (* With the agent e and related entity z, we can establish the target e and inhibition. *)
  then have "Target e" and "Inhibit e" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the derived information, we can derive the required conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
