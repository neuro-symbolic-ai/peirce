(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly leads to chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ DirectlyLeads e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 is a direct cause of chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. LossOfBRCA2 e ⟶ DirectCause e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ Cause e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e" by simp
  (* We have two relevant explanation sentences: Loss of BRCA2 directly leads to chromosome breakage and Loss of BRCA2 is a direct cause of chromosome breakage. *)
  (* From the first explanation, Loss of BRCA2 directly leads to chromosome breakage, we can infer ChromosomeBreakage e. *)
  obtain e where "LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ DirectlyLeads e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e" using explanation_1 by blast
  then have "ChromosomeBreakage e" by simp
  (* From the second explanation, Loss of BRCA2 is a direct cause of chromosome breakage, we can infer DirectCause e. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 e" by (simp add: \<open>LossOfBRCA2 e \<and> DirectlyLeads e \<and> ChromosomeBreakage e\<close>)
  then have "DirectCause e" by (simp add: explanation_2)
  (* Combining the inferred ChromosomeBreakage e and DirectCause e, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ DirectCause e ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e" using \<open>ChromosomeBreakage e\<close> \<open>LossOfBRCA2 e\<close> by blast
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
