(* Explanation 1: Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Received e ∧ Vinorelbine e ∧ Cisplatin e ∧ FirstLineTreatment e"

(* Explanation 2: Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. VinorelbineCisplatin x ⟶ ChemotherapyTreatment x"

(* Explanation 3: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Treated e ∧ Chemotherapy e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Received e ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x e where "Patient x ∧ Received e ∧ Vinorelbine e ∧ Cisplatin e ∧ FirstLineTreatment e" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment, Patient should be treated with chemotherapy) *)
  (* Since the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment, we can infer that the patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_3 obtain e' where "Patient x ∧ Treated e' ∧ Chemotherapy e'" by auto
  (* We can combine the information to show that the patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Received e ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis by auto
