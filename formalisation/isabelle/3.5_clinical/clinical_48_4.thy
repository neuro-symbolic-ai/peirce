(* Explanation 1: The absence of SS breaks implies the absence of HRR activation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y. AbsenceOfSSBreaks x ∧ AbsenceOfHRRAcivation y ⟶ Implies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DSB y"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB *)
 shows "∃e. Results e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that InhibitionOfPARP x is true. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x" by simp
  (* From the explanation sentence, we have Implies e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ AbsenceOfSSBreaks x ∧ AbsenceOfHRRAcivation y *)
  (* Since we have InhibitionOfPARP x, we can infer AbsenceOfSSBreaks x and AbsenceOfHRRAcivation y. *)
  then have "AbsenceOfSSBreaks x ∧ AbsenceOfHRRAcivation y" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis states that CollapsedReplicationForks y and DSB y are true. *)
  (* We can combine the known information to get CollapsedReplicationForks y and DSB y. *)
  from asm have "CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DSB y" <ATP>
  (* Now, we have all the necessary conditions to conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Results e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" for e
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
