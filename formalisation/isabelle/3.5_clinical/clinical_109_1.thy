(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ With e ∧ BreastCancer e x HER2"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ With e ∧ KnownMutation e x V777LHER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ With e ∧ Mutation e x V777LHER2 ∧ Amplification e x HER2 ∧ BreastCancer e x HER2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient exists. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer *)
  (* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation) *)
  (* We can combine these two explanations to infer the hypothesis. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x1 e1 where "Patient x1 ∧ With e1 ∧ BreastCancer e1 x1 HER2" by auto
  from explanation_2 obtain x2 e2 where "Patient x2 ∧ With e2 ∧ KnownMutation e2 x2 V777LHER2" by auto
  (* We can combine the information from both explanations to derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ With e1 ∧ Mutation e1 x V777LHER2 ∧ Amplification e1 x HER2 ∧ BreastCancer e1 x HER2" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
