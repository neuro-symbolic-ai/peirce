(* Explanation 1: Lapatinib and neratinib being effective against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain implies that they are effective in breast cancer patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Lapatinib x ∧ Neratinib y ∧ TumorsWithMutations z ∧ KinaseDomain z ⟶ EffectiveAgainst x z ∧ EffectiveAgainst y z ∧ BreastCancerPatients z"

(* Explanation 2: The efficacy of Lapatinib and neratinib against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain leads to their effectiveness in breast cancer patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Efficacy x ∧ Lapatinib y ∧ Neratinib z ∧ TumorsWithMutations z ∧ KinaseDomain z ⟶ (LeadsToEffectiveness x BreastCancerPatients ∧ LeadsToEffectiveness y BreastCancerPatients)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients may benefit from treatment with Neratinib or Lapatinib or may be able to access a clinical trial for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment e ∧ (Neratinib y ∨ Lapatinib y) ∧ BenefitFrom e x y ∨ AccessClinicalTrial e x ∧ TreatmentOf e y (ERBB2 V777L)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences related to the effectiveness of Lapatinib and Neratinib. *)
  (* Explanation 1: Lapatinib and neratinib being effective against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain implies that they are effective in breast cancer patients. *)
  (* Explanation 2: The efficacy of Lapatinib and neratinib against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain leads to their effectiveness in breast cancer patients. *)
  (* We can infer that Lapatinib and Neratinib are effective in breast cancer patients. *)
  then have "EffectiveAgainst Lapatinib z ∧ EffectiveAgainst Neratinib z ∧ BreastCancerPatients z" sledgehammer
  (* Since the patient is not directly related to Lapatinib or Neratinib, we need to consider the implications of effectiveness in breast cancer patients. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Lapatinib and neratinib being effective against tumors with mutations in the kinase domain, they are effective in breast cancer patients) *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient may benefit from treatment with Neratinib or Lapatinib. *)
  then have "∃y. (Neratinib y ∨ Lapatinib y) ∧ BenefitFrom e x y" sledgehammer
  (* Additionally, the patient may be able to access a clinical trial for the treatment of ERBB2 V777L. *)
  then have "∃e. AccessClinicalTrial e x ∧ TreatmentOf e y (ERBB2 V777L)" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above two inferences, we obtain the desired conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
