(* Explanation 1: A TTK Inhibitor being effective in a patient implies that the TTK Inhibitor is potentially beneficial for the patient's condition *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective z ∧ In x y ∧ BeneficialFor z y ⟶ PotentialBenefit x y"

(* Explanation 2: The effectiveness of a TTK Inhibitor in a patient can suggest that the TTK Inhibitor may be suitable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective z ∧ In x y ⟶ (Suggest z ∧ SuitableFor x y)"

(* Explanation 3: If a TTK Inhibitor is effective in a patient, it indicates a potential positive outcome for the patient's treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective z ∧ In x y ⟶ (Indicates z ∧ PositiveOutcome x y)"

(* Explanation 4: The effectiveness of a TTK Inhibitor in a patient may lead to the conclusion that the TTK Inhibitor could be a suitable treatment option for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z w. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective z ∧ In x y ⟶ (LeadTo z ∧ Conclusion w ∧ Suitable x ∧ TreatmentOption w x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the TTK Inhibitor and the patient. *)
  from asm have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" by auto
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to infer that if a TTK Inhibitor is effective in a patient, it may suggest suitability. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(TTK Inhibitor being effective in a patient, TTK Inhibitor may be suitable for the patient) *)
  (* Using Explanation 2, we can conclude that the TTK Inhibitor may be suitable for the patient. *)
  then have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
