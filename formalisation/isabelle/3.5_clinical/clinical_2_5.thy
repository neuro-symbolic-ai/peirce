(* Explanation 1: PARP inhibitors cause defective homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair y ⟶ CauseRepair x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x"
 (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ SyntheticLethality e ∧ Cause e z ∧ RelyOn e cells ∧ Mechanism e singular ∧ Repair e cumulativeDamage DNA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that patients have a loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x" by blast
  (* Given the explanation sentence that PARP inhibitors cause defective homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We can infer that loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality. *)
  have "PARPInhibitors y ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair z ⟶ CauseRepair y z" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* To achieve the hypothesis, we need to show the existence of patients with specific properties. *)
  (* Therefore, we can instantiate the variables to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ SyntheticLethality e ∧ Cause e z ∧ RelyOn e cells ∧ Mechanism e singular ∧ Repair e cumulativeDamage DNA" sledgehammer
