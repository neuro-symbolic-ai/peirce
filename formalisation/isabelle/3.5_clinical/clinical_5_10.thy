(* Explanation 1: Specify that the inhibition of PARP x directly leads to the occurrence of collapsed replication forks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ Leads e ∧ Directly e ∧ To e y ∧ OccurrenceOf y ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y"

(* Explanation 2: Clarify that the inhibition of PARP x directly leads to the occurrence of double strand break *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ Leads e ∧ Directly e ∧ To e y ∧ OccurrenceOf y ∧ DoubleStrandBreak y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break *)
 shows "∃e x y. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ Results e ∧ In e x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DoubleStrandBreak y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that InhibitionOfPARP x is true. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x" by blast
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences that directly link InhibitionOfPARP x to the occurrence of collapsed replication forks and double strand break. *)
  (* We can use these explanations to infer the occurrence of collapsed replication forks and double strand break. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "∃e y. Leads e ∧ Directly e ∧ To e y ∧ OccurrenceOf y ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y" by presburger
  from explanation_2 and asm have "∃e y. Leads e ∧ Directly e ∧ To e y ∧ OccurrenceOf y ∧ DoubleStrandBreak y" by blast
  (* Combining the above two inferences, we can conclude that InhibitionOfPARP x results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break. *)
