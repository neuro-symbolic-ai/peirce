(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies that it can cause chromosome breakage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ HumanProtein e ⟶ (CanCause e ∧ Patient e e ChromosomeBreakage)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HumanProtein x"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
 shows "∃e. LossOfBRCA2 e ∧ CanCause e ∧ Patient e e ChromosomeBreakage"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the entity x is a HumanProtein. *)
  from asm have "HumanProtein x" <ATP>
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 being a human protein implies it can cause chromosome breakage. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that LossOfBRCA2 x can cause chromosome breakage. *)
  then have "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CanCause x ∧ Patient x x ChromosomeBreakage" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
