(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 protein being a tumor suppressor implies that it is involved in homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumorSuppressor x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2Protein x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair *)
 shows "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2Protein x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2Protein x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 protein being a tumor suppressor, BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair) *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" sledgehammer
  (* Since BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair, we can conclude that it is a human protein. *)
  then have "HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
