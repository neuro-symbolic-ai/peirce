(* Explanation 1: When the PIK3CA gene is mutated, it directly leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. PIK3CA x ∧ Gene y ∧ Mutated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Directly z ∧ Leads z ∧ Cause e z (ActivationOfPI3KPathway z)"

(* Explanation 2: The activation of the PI3K pathway by PIK3CA mutations results in the occurrence of activating point mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. ActivationOfPI3KPathway x ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ Mutation e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ⟶ (Result e ∧ OccurrenceOfActivatingPointMutations e)"

(* Explanation 3: The mutation of the PIK3CA gene implies the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. PIK3CA x ∧ Gene y ∧ Mutation e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ⟶ Implies e ∧ ActivationOfPI3KPathway y"

(* Explanation 4: The activation of the PI3K pathway leads to the occurrence of activating point mutations. *)

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PIK3CA x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  shows "Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3CA gene is mutated. *)
  from asm have "PIK3CA x" by blast
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PIK3CA gene is mutated, activation of the PI3K pathway). *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
  then have "ActivationOfPI3KPathway x" sledgehammer
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(activation of the PI3K pathway, occurrence of activating point mutations). *)
  (* From the activation of the PI3K pathway, we can deduce the occurrence of activating point mutations. *)
  then have "OccurrenceOfActivatingPointMutations x" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the derived implication Implies(A, C), Implies(PIK3CA gene is mutated, occurrence of activating point mutations). *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the PIK3CA gene mutation leads to the occurrence of activating point mutations. *)
  
  (* The hypothesis involves Known, Frequent, ActivatingMutation, and BreastCancer. *)
  (* However, we have not explicitly established the relationship between PIK3CA mutation and Known, Frequent, ActivatingMutation, and BreastCancer. *)
  (* Further steps are needed to connect the mutation to these specific properties. *)
  
  (* Therefore, the proof is not yet complete and requires additional reasoning steps. *)
