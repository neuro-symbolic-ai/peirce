(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor that is involved in chromosomal stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
 shows "∃x. BRCA2 x ⟶ (HumanGene x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentence 1: Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein) *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 x implies HumanGene x and Encodes x BRCA2Protein. *)
  then have "HumanGene x ∧ Encodes x BRCA2Protein" <ATP>
  (* We have explanatory sentence 2: Implies(C, D), Implies(BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor, BRCA2 protein is involved in chromosomal stability) *)
  (* Since BRCA2 protein is involved in chromosomal stability, we can infer InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability. *)
  then have "HumanGene x ∧ InvolvedIn x ChromosomalStability" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
