(* Explanation 1: The possibility of the event EffectiveInhibiting e occurring is denoted by the statement May e. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. May e ⟷ EffectiveInhibiting e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
 shows "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ Effective e ∧ Inhibiting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a YAP inhibitor x and β-catenin activity y. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y" by simp
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we have the logical proposition A: May e ⟷ EffectiveInhibiting e *)
  (* Since May e is equivalent to EffectiveInhibiting e, we can infer EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
  then have "EffectiveInhibiting e" sledgehammer
  (* We can further infer Inhibiting e from EffectiveInhibiting e. *)
  then have "Inhibiting e" <ATP>
  (* We already have YAPInhibitor x and βCateninActivity y, and we inferred Effective e and Inhibiting e. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the existence of x, y, and e satisfying the required conditions. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
