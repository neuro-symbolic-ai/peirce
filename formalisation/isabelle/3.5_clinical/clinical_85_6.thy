(* Explanation 1: Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer are specifically identified by the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ∧ Patient y ∧ DiagnosedWith y x ⟶ (NoExpression y HER2 ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y"
 (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can see that the patient has breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y" by auto
  (* We know that patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer have the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, (B and C and D)), Implies(Patients diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, absence of PR expression) *)
  (* We can infer the absence of HER-2 expression, ER expression, and PR expression for the breast cancer y. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "NoExpression y HER2 ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR" sledgehammer
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude that the patient has breast cancer with no expression of ER, PR, or HER-2. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HasCancer x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
