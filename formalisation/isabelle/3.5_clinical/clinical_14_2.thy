(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ InHumans z"

(* Explanation 2: SpecificallyIn x y implies InHumans x *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. SpecificallyIn x y ∧ InHumans z ⟶ InHumans x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ InHumans z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about BRCA2, repair molecules, undamaged, and homologous. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y" by meson
  from asm have "Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y" by auto
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans, SpecificallyIn x y) *)
  (* We can infer SpecificallyIn x y from BRCA2 x and RepairMolecules y. *)
  then obtain z e where "Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ InHumans z" sledgehammer
  (* We have obtained the necessary information to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
