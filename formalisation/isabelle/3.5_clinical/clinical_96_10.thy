(* Explanation 1: If a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, then the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ HasMutation z x y ⟶ (Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient z ∧ With x z)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib, then the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ With x z ⟶ (Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ HasMutation x z y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ With x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation and is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z" by blast
  (* Using Explanation 2: If a patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib, then the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation and has a mutation related to the treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ HasMutation x z y" sledgehammer
  (* Using Explanation 1: If a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, then the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient is receiving treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Common_BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ With x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
