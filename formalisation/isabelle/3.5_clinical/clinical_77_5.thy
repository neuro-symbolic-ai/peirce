(* Explanation 1: The binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x y. Binding e ∧ Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e PI3K ∧ To PI3K PlasmaMembrane"

(* Explanation 2: The binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together relieves inhibition of p *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e x y. Binding e ∧ Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Relieves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e InhibitionOfP"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Inhibition z"
  (* Hypothesis: The binding of the p85 subunit and p110 relieves inhibition of p110 and mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane *)
 shows "∃e x y z. Binding e ∧ Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Relieves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e PI3K ∧ To PI3K PlasmaMembrane"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the subunits p85 and p110, and inhibition z. *)
  from asm have "Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Inhibition z" by blast
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that the binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together, mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer that the binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together mediates the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane. *)
  then obtain e x y where "Binding e ∧ Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e PI3K ∧ To PI3K PlasmaMembrane" by (rule explanation_1) sledgehammer
  (* We also know from explanatory sentence 2 that the binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together relieves inhibition of p. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together, relieves inhibition of p) *)
  (* Both A and C are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer that the binding of the p85 subunit and p110 together relieves inhibition of p. *)
  then obtain e' where "Binding e' ∧ Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Relieves e' ∧ Agent e' x ∧ Patient e' InhibitionOfP" by (rule explanation_2) sledgehammer
  (* Combining the information from both explanatory sentences, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Binding e ∧ Subunit p85 x ∧ Subunit p110 y ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Relieves e' ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e PI3K ∧ To PI3K PlasmaMembrane" sledgehammer
