(* Explanation 1: BRAF is a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BRAF x ⟶ RASRegulated x ∧ Cytoplasmic x ∧ SerineThreonineKinase x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
 (* Hypothesis: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
 shows "ProtoOncogene x ∧ PlaysRoles x MAPKERKSignalingPathway"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about BRAF. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by fastforce
  (* BRAF is related to the logical proposition A. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that BRAF is a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase. *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF is a proto-oncogene and plays roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹BRAF x› have "ProtoOncogene x ∧ PlaysRoles x MAPKERKSignalingPathway" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
