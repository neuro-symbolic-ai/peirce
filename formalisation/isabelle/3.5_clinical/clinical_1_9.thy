(* Explanation 1: The interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors licensed for use in prostate cancer patients leads to the existence of two potential treatment options for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Olaparib x ∧ Rucaparib y ∧ PARP1Inhibitor z ∧ ProstateCancerPatient z ∧ LicensedFor z x ∧ LicensedFor z y ∧ LeadsTo e ∧ Patient e z ∧ TreatmentOption e x ∧ TreatmentOption e y ∧ Potential x ∧ Potential y"

(* Explanation 2: The patient having access to Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors implies that there are two potential treatment options available for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Olaparib y ∧ Rucaparib z ∧ PARP1Inhibitor y ∧ PARP1Inhibitor z ∧ AccessTo x y ∧ AccessTo x z ∧ Implies e ∧ TreatmentOption e y ∧ TreatmentOption e z ∧ Potential y ∧ Potential z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ Potential y ∧ LeadsTo x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient is x. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors licensed for use in prostate cancer patients, existence of two potential treatment options for the patient) *)
  (* We can infer the existence of two potential treatment options for the patient from the interchangeability of Olaparib and Rucaparib as PARP1 inhibitors. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ Potential y ∧ LeadsTo x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
