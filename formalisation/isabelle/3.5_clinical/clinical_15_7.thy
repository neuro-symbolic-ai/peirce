(* Explanation 1: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x) ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity x, if x is RAD51 homolog 1 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. (RAD51Homolog1 x ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x) ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

(* Explanation 3: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 and x is RAD51 homolog 1, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x) ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"
