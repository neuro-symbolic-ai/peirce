theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x"
  (* Hypothesis: If a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x ∧ BenefitFrom e ∧ Treatment e AlpelisibFulvestrant ∧ Target e PIK3CA"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x has received endocrine therapy e. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously, patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can infer that the patient x is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ LessSensitive x Chemotherapy" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(C), Not(A)), Implies(Not(patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy), Not(using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival)) *)
  (* Since the patient x is less sensitive to chemotherapy, we can infer that using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
  then have "KinaseInhibitor e ∧ Target e PI3KAKT ∧ Inhibit e PI3KAKT Proliferation ∧ Inhibit e PI3KAKT Survival" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival, patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy) *)
  (* We can conclude that the patient x is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy and may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  then have "∃x e. Patient x ∧ ReceivedEndocrineTherapy e x ∧ BenefitFrom e ∧ Treatment e AlpelisibFulvestrant ∧ Target e PIK3CA" <ATP>
