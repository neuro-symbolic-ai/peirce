(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if x is involved in HRR in humans, then x is involved in HRR *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (InvolvedInHRRInHumans x ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x)"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is involved in HRR, then it is involved in HRR in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. (InvolvedInHRR x ⟶ InvolvedInHRRInHumans x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in HRR in humans *)
 shows "InvolvedInHRR x ∧ InHumans x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "RAD51Homolog1 x" apply simp
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, if an entity is involved in HRR, then it is involved in HRR in humans. *)
  (* We can infer that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR in humans. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹BRCA2 x› have "InvolvedInHRRInHumans x" by (simp add: assms)
  from explanation_2 and ‹RAD51Homolog1 x› have "InvolvedInHRRInHumans x" sledgehammer
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, for all entities x, if x is involved in HRR in humans, then x is involved in HRR. *)
  (* Therefore, BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹InvolvedInHRRInHumans x› have "InvolvedInHRR x" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above results, we can conclude that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in HRR and in HRR in humans. *)
  then show "InvolvedInHRR x ∧ InHumans x" <ATP>
