(* Explanation 1: For all entities x, if x is a PARP inhibitor and x targets tumor-specific defects in DNA repair, then x is used for the treatment of the patient y with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative, AdvancedOrMetastaticBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (PARPInhibitor x ∧ Targets x (TumorSpecificDefectsInDNARepair x)) ⟶ (TreatmentFor x y)"

(* Explanation 2: The treatment administered to the patient y with specific characteristics includes the PARP inhibitors Olaparib and Talazoparib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀y. (Patient y ∧ SpecificCharacteristics y) ⟶ (TreatmentAdministered y ∧ IncludesTreatment y Olaparib ∧ IncludesTreatment y Talazoparib)"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Olaparib x ∧ Talazoparib x"
  (* Hypothesis: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC *)
  shows "PARPInhibitor x ∧ (∃y. TreatmentFor x y ∧ BRCA y ∧ HER y ∧ AdvancedOrMetastaticBC y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Olaparib and Talazoparib are PARP inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitor x" <ATP>
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating that if an entity is a PARP inhibitor and targets tumor-specific defects in DNA repair, it is used for the treatment of a patient with specific characteristics. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, x is used for the treatment of the patient y with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC) *)
  (* Since we have PARPInhibitor x, we can infer that x is used for the treatment of a patient with specific characteristics. *)
  then have "∃y. TreatmentFor x y" <ATP>
  (* We also know that the patient y with specific characteristics includes BRCA-mutated and HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC. *)
  then have "∃y. TreatmentFor x y ∧ BRCA y ∧ HER y ∧ AdvancedOrMetastaticBC y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
