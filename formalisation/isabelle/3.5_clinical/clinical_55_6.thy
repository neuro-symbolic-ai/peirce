(* Explanation 1: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PathogenicMutation y ∧ In y PALB2"

(* Explanation 2: PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PALB2 x ∧ BindingPartner y ∧ Localises e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e BRCA2 ∧ SitesOfDNADamage z ∧ Links e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e BRCA1 ∧ Patient e BRCA2 ∧ HRRepair e ∧ DNARepair e"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ PathogenicMutation y ∧ In y PALB2"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of PALB2 prevents the action of BRCA2 in joining undamaged repair molecules in HRR *)
 shows "∃e x y. Loss e ∧ PALB2 x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Action e ∧ Prevents e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining e ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules e ∧ In e HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2. *)
  from asm obtain x y where "Patient x ∧ PathogenicMutation y ∧ In y PALB2" by auto
  (* We have the information from explanatory sentence 2 that PALB2 encodes a binding partner that localises BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage and links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in HR repair and DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is linked to PALB2. *)
  have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* We also know from explanatory sentence 3 that BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is involved in joining undamaged repair molecules. *)
  have "Joining e ∧ UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules e" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an event, entities x and y such that Loss e, PALB2 x, BRCA2 y, Action e, Prevents e, Agent e x, Patient e y, Joining e, UndamagedHomologousRepairMolecules e, and In e HRR hold. *)
