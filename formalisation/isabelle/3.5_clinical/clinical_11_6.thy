(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly influences the repair mechanism to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes in the cell, leading to the cell favoring non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ RepairMechanism y ∧ Cell z ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e1 ∧ Influences e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In e1 z ∧ LeadingTo e2 ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Favoring e2 ∧ Patient e2 y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
 shows "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Loss of BRCA2 and the cell. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x" and "Cell y" apply simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2, repair mechanism defaults to non-homologous end joining repair processes in the cell) *)
  (* We can infer that Loss of BRCA2 leads to the repair mechanism defaulting to non-homologous end joining repair processes in the cell. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(repair mechanism defaults to non-homologous end joining repair processes in the cell, cell favors non-homologous end joining repair processes) *)
  (* Therefore, Loss of BRCA2 also leads to the cell favoring non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
  then have "Cell y ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" by (simp add: assms)
