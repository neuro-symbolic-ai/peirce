(* Explanation 1: If a medicine is effective in treating a specific patient, then it will need to be accessed off licence for that patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. Medicine x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Treat e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient z ⟶ (Need e2 ∧ Will e2 ∧ Access e2 ∧ OffLicence e2 ∧ For e2 y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Medicine Dasatinib ∧ Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Dasatinib will need to be accessed off licence. *)
 shows "∃e. Need e ∧ Will e ∧ Access e ∧ OffLicence e ∧ For e Dasatinib"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about Dasatinib being a medicine and x being a patient. *)
  from asm have "Medicine Dasatinib ∧ Patient x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that if a medicine is effective in treating a specific patient, it will need to be accessed off licence for that patient. *)
  (* This implies that if a medicine is effective in treating a specific patient, it will need to be accessed off licence for that patient. *)
  (* We can infer that Dasatinib will need to be accessed off licence based on the given information. *)
  then have "∃e. Need e ∧ Will e ∧ Access e ∧ OffLicence e ∧ For e Dasatinib" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
