(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 directly influences the repair mechanism to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ RepairMechanism y ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e ∧ Influences e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "RepairMechanism y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes *)
 shows "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ Cell y ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the repair mechanism. *)
  from asm have "RepairMechanism y" by blast
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that Loss of BRCA2 influences the repair mechanism to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
  (* We can use the logical proposition Implies(A, B), which states Implies(Loss of BRCA2, repair mechanism defaults to non-homologous end joining repair processes). *)
  (* Since we know RepairMechanism y, we can infer LossOfBRCA2 x. *)
  then have "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ RepairMechanism y ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e ∧ Influences e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* The hypothesis is about LossOfBRCA2 causing the cell to default to non-homologous end joining repair processes. *)
  (* We can simplify the statement to match the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ DefaultToNonHomologousEndJoiningRepairProcesses e ∧ Influences e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" by blast
