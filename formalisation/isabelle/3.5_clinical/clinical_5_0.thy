(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting PARP results in accumulation of single strand breaks *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. InhibitingPARP e ⟶ AccumulationOfSingleStrandBreaks e"

(* Explanation 2: Single strand breaks collapse replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e1 e2. SingleStrandBreaks e1 ⟶ (CollapsedReplicationForks e2 ∧ Trigger e2 HomologousRecombinationRepair)"

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitingPARP e"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break *)
 shows "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Inhibiting PARP results in the accumulation of single strand breaks. *)
  from asm have "InhibitingPARP e ⟶ AccumulationOfSingleStrandBreaks e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inhibiting PARP, accumulation of single strand breaks) *)
  (* We can infer that Inhibiting PARP leads to the accumulation of single strand breaks. *)
  then have "AccumulationOfSingleStrandBreaks e" <ATP>
  (* From the known information and Explanation 2, we can deduce that single strand breaks lead to collapsed replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹AccumulationOfSingleStrandBreaks e› have "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ Trigger e HomologousRecombinationRepair" <ATP>
  (* Since collapsed replication forks are a consequence of single strand breaks, we can conclude that Inhibiting PARP results in collapsed replication forks. *)
  then have "CollapsedReplicationForks e" <ATP>
  (* Additionally, from the logical relation Implies(B, C and D), we can infer that accumulation of single strand breaks leads to trigger homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "Trigger e HomologousRecombinationRepair" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, Inhibiting PARP results in collapsed replication forks and trigger homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
