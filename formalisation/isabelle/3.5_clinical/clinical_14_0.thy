(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Humans z ⟶ (InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x z ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair y z)"

(* Explanation 2: The binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RAD51Homolog1 y ∧ Binding z ∧ Catalyzes e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Joining y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Humans z"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Promotes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Joining z ∧ Via z RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that humans are involved. *)
  from asm have "Humans z" by auto
  (* We have an explanatory sentence stating that BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Humans z› have "BRCA2 x" sledgehammer
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the binding of BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  (* This implies that BRCA2 catalyzes the joining of undamaged homologous molecules. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹BRCA2 x› have "Joining y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y" <ATP>
  (* Since BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair, it promotes the process. *)
  then have "Promotes e" <ATP>
  (* We also know that the agent of this process is x and the patient is z. *)
  then have "Agent e x ∧ Patient e z" <ATP>
  (* Additionally, the process is happening in humans. *)
  then have "InHumans z" <ATP>
  (* We are given that the process is via RAD51 homolog 1. *)
  then have "Via z RAD51Homolog1" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude the existence of x, y, z, and e satisfying the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
