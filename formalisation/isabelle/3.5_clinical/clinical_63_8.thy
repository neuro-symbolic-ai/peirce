(* Explanation 1: Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are specifically related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes, but not both simultaneously *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. HRR x ∧ Repairing e ∧ DNA y ∧ HomologousMolecules z ∧ UsedFor e z ∧ ((RelatedTo e z (SisterChromatids z) ∨ RelatedTo e z (PaternalCopies z)) ∧ ¬(RelatedTo e z (SisterChromatids z) ∧ RelatedTo e z (PaternalCopies z)))"

(* Explanation 2: If undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, then they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. HomologousMolecules x ∧ RelatedTo x (PaternalCopies y) ⟶ ¬RelatedTo x (SisterChromatids y) ∧ (HomologousMolecules x ∧ RelatedTo x (SisterChromatids y) ⟶ ¬RelatedTo x (PaternalCopies y))"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DNA z ∧ Damaged z"
  (* Hypothesis: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes *)
 shows "∃x y z e. HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DNA z ∧ Damaged z ∧ (∃e. HomologousMolecules e ∧ From e y ∧ Replace e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e z ∧ With e y) ∧ (SisterChromatids y ∨ PaternalCopies y ∨ MaternalCopies y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about HRR, DSBRepairProcess, DNA, and Damaged. *)
  from asm have "HRR x ∧ DSBRepairProcess y ∧ DNA z ∧ Damaged z" <ATP>
  
  (* We know from Explanation 1 that undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes, but not both simultaneously. *)
  (* This implies that if undamaged homologous molecules are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, then they are not related to sister chromatids, and vice versa. *)
  (* We can use this information to infer the relationship between homologous molecules and sister chromatids or paternal copies. *)
  
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, Not(A)), Implies(Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are related to paternal copies of chromosomes, Not(Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are related to sister chromatids)) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, Not(B)), Implies(Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are related to sister chromatids, Not(Undamaged homologous molecules used for repairing DNA by HRR are related to paternal copies of chromosomes)) *)
  
  (* We can use the derived implications to infer the relationship between homologous molecules and sister chromatids or paternal copies. *)
  
  (* Since the undamaged homologous molecules are used for repairing DNA in the DSB repair process, we can conclude that they are related to either sister chromatids or paternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* We can also infer the other conditions related to the repair process. *)
