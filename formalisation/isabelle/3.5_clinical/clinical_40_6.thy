(* Explanation 1: For any patient x with hepatoblastoma, there exists a related entity w such that there is an activating mutation z in CTNNB1, and this activating mutation z is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x ⟶ (∃w z. Related w x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ DirectlyLinked z x x)"

(* Explanation 2: The presence of hepatoblastoma in a patient implies the existence of an activating mutation in CTNNB1 in a related entity that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x ⟶ (∃w z. Related w x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ DirectlyLinked z x x)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ DirectlyLinked z x x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is related to hepatoblastoma. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma x" sledgehammer
  (* From the explanation sentences, we have the information that for any patient x with hepatoblastoma, there exists a related entity w such that there is an activating mutation z in CTNNB1, and this activating mutation z is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  (* This implies the existence of an activating mutation z in CTNNB1 that is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  then obtain w z where "Related w x ∧ ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ DirectlyLinked z x x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that there exists an x and z such that the patient x has an activating mutation z in CTNNB1, and z is directly linked to the patient's condition of hepatoblastoma. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
