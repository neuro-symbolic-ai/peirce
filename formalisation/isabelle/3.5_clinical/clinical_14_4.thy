(* Explanation 1: For any x and y, if there is a specific relationship between x and y, and there is a consequence between x and y, then the consequence is a result of the specific relationship. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Relationship x y ∧ Consequence x y z ⟶ Result z"

(* Explanation 2: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is a direct result of the specific relationship inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Consequence x y z ∧ DirectResult z ∧ InferredRelationship z BRCA2 ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e BRCA2 ∧ Patient e RepairMolecules ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  shows "∃x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRCA2 x. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" <ATP>
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have the relationship between BRCA2, repair molecules, RAD51 homolog 1, and humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(The consequence is a result of the specific relationship, BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans) *)
  (* We can infer the required information about repair molecules, undamaged, homologous, joining, agent, patient, via, and in humans. *)
  then have "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecules y ∧ Undamaged y ∧ Homologous y ∧ Joining e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e RAD51Homolog1 ∧ InHumans e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
