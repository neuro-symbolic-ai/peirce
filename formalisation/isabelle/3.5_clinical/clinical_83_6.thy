(* Explanation 1: If a patient receives vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment, then the treatment is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z ⟶ (SpecificallyIdentified e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y)"

(* Explanation 2: First-line chemotherapy is the initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. FirstLineChemotherapy x ⟶ (InitialChemotherapyTreatment y ∧ GivenToPatient e ∧ ForCondition e y)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
 shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get the known information about the patient and first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(first-line chemotherapy is the initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition, treatment is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy) *)
  (* We already have FirstLineChemotherapy y, so we can infer that the treatment is specifically identified as first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ SpecificallyIdentified e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(patient receives vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment, first-line chemotherapy is the initial chemotherapy treatment given to a patient for a particular condition) *)
  (* We already have Patient x and FirstLineChemotherapy y, so we can infer that the patient received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
