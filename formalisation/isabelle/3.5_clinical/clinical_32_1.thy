(* Explanation 1: If a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then the treatment involving the Notch inhibitor is not available for that patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ Effective z x y ⟶ NotAvailable (Treatment z) x"

(* Explanation 2: If a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then there are no licensed Notch inhibitors available *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ Effective x y ⟶ ¬∃z. Licensed (NotchInhibitor z)"

(* Explanation 3: If a Notch inhibitor may be effective in a patient, then there are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for pediatric patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y ∧ Effective x y ⟶ ¬∃z. InClinicalTrials z ∧ PediatricPatient z"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y"
  (* Hypothesis: This treatment is not available for this patient *)
  shows "∃x y. Treatment x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotAvailable x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the patient and the Notch inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ NotchInhibitor y" <ATP>
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(A, B) to infer the treatment involving the Notch inhibitor is not available for that patient. *)
  (* This is derived from Explanation 1. *)
  from asm and explanation_1 have "NotAvailable (Treatment z) x" <ATP>
  (* We can then existentially quantify over x and y to show that the treatment is not available for this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. Treatment x ∧ Patient y ∧ NotAvailable x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
