(* Explanation 1: If Dasatinib is effective in treating a specific patient, then it will need to be accessed off licence for that patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e1 e2. Dasatinib x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Treat e1 ∧ For e1 x y ∧ Need e2 ∧ Will e2 ∧ Access e2 ∧ OffLicence e2 ∧ For e2 y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Dasatinib x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Treat e1 ∧ For e1 x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Dasatinib will need to be accessed off licence. *)
 shows "∃e. Need e ∧ Will e ∧ Access e ∧ OffLicence e ∧ For e Dasatinib"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about Dasatinib, Patient, Effective, Treat, and For. *)
  from asm have "Dasatinib x ∧ Patient y ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Treat e1 ∧ For e1 x y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Dasatinib is effective in treating a specific patient, Dasatinib needs to be accessed off licence for that patient) *)
  (* We have Dasatinib x and Patient y from the premise, which are related to A. *)
  (* We can infer the need for accessing off licence based on the logical relation. *)
  then have "Need e2 ∧ Will e2 ∧ Access e2 ∧ OffLicence e2 ∧ For e2 y" <ATP>
  (* We need to existentially quantify over e2 to complete the proof. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
