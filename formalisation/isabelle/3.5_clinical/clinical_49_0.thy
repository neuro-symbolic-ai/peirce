(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ IncreasedGenomicInstability y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. IncreasedGenomicInstability x ∧ CancerHallmark y ∧ IsHallmarkOf x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know about BRCA2, CancerDevelopment, and GenomicInstability. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x" and "CancerDevelopment y" and "GenomicInstability z" apply simp
  (* From the explanation 1, we have the relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Loss of BRCA2, increased genomic instability). *)
  (* We already have BRCA2 x, so we can infer IncreasedGenomicInstability. *)
  then obtain a where "IncreasedGenomicInstability a" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* From the explanation 2, we have the relation Implies(B, C), Implies(increased genomic instability, hallmark of cancer). *)
  (* We already have IncreasedGenomicInstability a, so we can infer CancerHallmark. *)
  then obtain b where "CancerHallmark b" by (simp add: assms)
  (* We have all the necessary information to prove the hypothesis. *)
