(* Explanation 1: Notch inhibitors can be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ⟶ (Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z"
 (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations *)
 shows "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient, CTNNB1 mutation, and activation. *)
  from asm have "Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations, Notch inhibitors can be effective) *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentence 1 to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ⟶ (Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z) *)
  then have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ For e y ∧ With e z" sledgehammer
