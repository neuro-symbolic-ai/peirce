(* Explanation 1: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e PARP1_2 ⟶ Purpose e PARP1_2 (TargetingDefects e)"

(* Explanation 2: For any entity e, if e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors, then the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e. Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e PARP1_2 ⟶ Manner e PARP1_2 (RecoveryFromDamage e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Inhibitors e ∧ TargetingDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ RoleOf e PARP1_2 ∧ Recover e ∧ FromDamage e"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
 shows "∃e. Inhibitors e ∧ TargetingDefects e ∧ DNARepair e ∧ RoleOf e PARP1_2 ∧ Recover e ∧ FromDamage e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that e is an agent in a process involving PARP1/2 inhibitors. *)
  have "Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e PARP1_2" <ATP>
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, B), we can infer the purpose of e is related to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e PARP1_2› have "Purpose e PARP1_2 (TargetingDefects e)" <ATP>
  (* Similarly, using the logical relation Implies(A, C), we can infer that the manner in which e acts is related to the recovery from DNA damage. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹Inhibitors e ∧ Agent e PARP1_2› have "Manner e PARP1_2 (RecoveryFromDamage e)" <ATP>
  (* Since we have all the necessary conditions, we can conclude that the hypothesis holds. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
