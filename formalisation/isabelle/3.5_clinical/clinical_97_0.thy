(* Explanation 1: Patient has BRAF V600E mutation, acquired new mutations and AR amplification. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BRAFV600E y ∧ Acquired x z ∧ NewMutations z ∧ Amplification z ∧ AR z"

(* Explanation 2: BRAF V600E is the most common BRAF mutation and results in constitutive hyperactivation and oncogenic transformation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. BRAFV600E x ∧ CommonBRAFMutation y ∧ Hyperactivation z ∧ OncogenicTransformation z ⟶ (Is x y ∧ ResultsIn x z)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ CommonBRAFV600E y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has the BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  from asm obtain y where "BRAFV600E y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* According to the explanation 2, BRAF V600E is the most common BRAF mutation, resulting in constitutive hyperactivation and oncogenic transformation. *)
  from `BRAFV600E y` obtain z where "CommonBRAFMutation z ∧ Hyperactivation z ∧ OncogenicTransformation z" sledgehammer
  (* We have found the common BRAF V600E mutation for the patient. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ CommonBRAFV600E z" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has the common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  then show ?thesis by auto
