(* Explanation 1: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2"

(* Explanation 2: The primary method for systemic management of both early-stage and metastatic settings is chemotherapy, which improves outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PrimaryMethod x ∧ SystemicManagement y ∧ EarlyStage z ∧ MetastaticSettings z ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ ImprovesOutcomes e TNBC"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has breast cancer with no expression of ER, PR, or HER2. *)
  from asm obtain y where "BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2" sledgehammer
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that the primary method for systemic management in both early-stage and metastatic settings is chemotherapy. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  then obtain z e where "PrimaryMethod z ∧ SystemicManagement z ∧ EarlyStage z ∧ MetastaticSettings z ∧ Chemotherapy e ∧ ImprovesOutcomes e TNBC" <ATP>
  then have "Patient x ∧ Treat e ∧ WithChemotherapy e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
