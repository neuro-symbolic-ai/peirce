(* Explanation 1: If a patient is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway, then they have an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ InPathway x CTNNB1 ⟶ (ActivatingMutation y ∧ InGene y CTNNB ∧ Have z x y)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ InGene y CTNNB ⟶ (InPathway x CTNNB1 ∧ Considered z x CTNNB1)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y. Drug x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ Effective y ∧ InPatient y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1: If a patient is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway, then they have an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  (* Explanation 2: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  (* Combining these two explanations, we can infer that the patient x has an activating mutation in CTNNB and is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation y ∧ InGene y CTNNB ∧ Have z x y ∧ InPathway x CTNNB1 ∧ Considered z x CTNNB1" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that there exists a drug targeting the Wnt pathway that may be effective in this patient. *)
  (* We can introduce a drug targeting the Wnt pathway and its effectiveness in the patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. Drug x ∧ Targeting x WntPathway ∧ Effective y ∧ InPatient y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
