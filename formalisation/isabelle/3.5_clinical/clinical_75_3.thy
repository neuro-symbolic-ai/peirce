(* Explanation 1: When the PIK3CA gene is mutated, it directly implies the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. PIK3CA x ∧ Gene y ∧ Mutated e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ Implies z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z PI3KPathway"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "PIK3CA x"
 (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
 shows "ActivatingMutation x ∧ BreastCancer x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that PIK3CA x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3CA x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PIK3CA gene is mutated, activation of the PI3K pathway) *)
  (* Since PIK3CA gene is mutated, it implies the activation of the PI3K pathway. *)
  then have "Implies PI3KPathway" sledgehammer
  (* The activation of the PI3K pathway implies an activating mutation. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation x" sledgehammer
  (* The activating mutation is in breast cancer. *)
  then have "BreastCancer x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
