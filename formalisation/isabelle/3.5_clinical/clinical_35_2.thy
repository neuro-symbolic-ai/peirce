(* Explanation 1: There exists at least one Notch inhibitor that can be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ ForPatient e y ∧ WithMutation e z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
 shows "∃x e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ ForPatient e y ∧ WithMutation e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient and CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that there exists at least one Notch inhibitor that can be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* This implies that there exists a Notch inhibitor that can be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of a Notch inhibitor that is effective in treating the given patient with the CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  then have "∃x e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Effective e ∧ InTreat e ∧ ForPatient e y ∧ WithMutation e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
