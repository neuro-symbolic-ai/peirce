(* Explanation 1: Patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer x"

(* Explanation 2: TNBC is a heterogeneous group of tumors comprising various breast cancers (BCs) defined as the absence of [ER and PR] with corresponding negativity for HER-2 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. TNBC x ∧ Tumors y ∧ BreastCancers y ∧ HeterogeneousGroup x y ∧ AbsenceOf x ER ∧ AbsenceOf x PR ∧ NegativityFor x HER2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ Has e x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2 *)
 shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ Has e x ∧ NoExpression e ∧ NoExpressionOf e ER ∧ NoExpressionOf e PR ∧ NoExpressionOf e HER2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has breast cancer and the patient has the breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, TNBC is a heterogeneous group of tumors comprising various breast cancers) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer is related to HER-2 expression. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer e ∧ Has e x ∧ NoExpression e ∧ NoExpressionOf e ER ∧ NoExpressionOf e PR ∧ NoExpressionOf e HER2" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
