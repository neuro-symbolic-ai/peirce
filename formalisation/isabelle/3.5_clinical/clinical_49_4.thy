(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 gene function leads to genomic instability *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e. LossBRCA2Function e ∧ Lead e ∧ GenomicInstability e"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor in driving cancer development *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e1 e2. LossBRCA2Function e1 ∧ Factor e2 ∧ Drive e2 ∧ CancerDevelopment e2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "LossBRCA2Function e"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
 shows "∃e. LossBRCA2Function e ∧ Drive e ∧ CancerDevelopment e ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a loss of BRCA2 gene function. *)
  from asm have "LossBRCA2Function e" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 that relate to the loss of BRCA2 gene function. *)
  (* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 gene function leads to genomic instability *)
  (* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 gene function is a factor in driving cancer development *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer GenomicInstability e. *)
  obtain e1 where e1: "LossBRCA2Function e1 ∧ Lead e1 ∧ GenomicInstability e1" using explanation_1 by blast
  then have "GenomicInstability e1" by simp
  (* From Explanation 2, we can infer Factor e2, Drive e2, and CancerDevelopment e2. *)
  obtain e2 where e2: "LossBRCA2Function e2 ∧ Factor e2 ∧ Drive e2 ∧ CancerDevelopment e2" sledgehammer
  then have "Factor e2" and "Drive e2" and "CancerDevelopment e2" <ATP>
  (* Since GenomicInstability e1 and Drive e2 are both related to the loss of BRCA2 gene function, we can combine them. *)
  have "LossBRCA2Function e1 ∧ Drive e2 ∧ CancerDevelopment e2 ∧ GenomicInstability e1" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
