(* Explanation 1: For any x and y, if there is a specific relationship between x and y, and there is a consequence between x and y, then the consequence is a result of the specific relationship *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y r c. Relationship x y r ∧ Consequence x y c ⟶ ResultOf c r"

(* Explanation 2: Specifically, the consequence between x and y is a direct result of the specific relationship inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y r c e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ RAD51Homolog1 r ∧ Human e ∧ Promotes c ∧ Agent c x ∧ Patient c y ∧ Via y r ∧ Relationship x y r ∧ Consequence x y c ∧ ResultOf c r"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Human e"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 promotes the joining of undamaged homologous repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans *)
 shows "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Human e ∧ Promotes x ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient x y ∧ Via y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRCA2, RepairMolecule, RAD51Homolog1, and Human. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Human e" <ATP>
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we know that the consequence between x and y is a result of the specific relationship inferred from BRCA2 promoting the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(The consequence is a result of the specific relationship, BRCA2 promotes the joining of repair molecules via RAD51 homolog 1 in humans) *)
  (* We can infer the hypothesis from the known information and the logical relation. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ RepairMolecule y ∧ RAD51Homolog1 z ∧ Human e ∧ Promotes x ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient x y ∧ Via y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
