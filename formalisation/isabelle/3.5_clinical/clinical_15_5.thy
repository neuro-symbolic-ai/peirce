(* Explanation 1: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1 and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x) ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is involved in homologous recombination repair, then it is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

(* Explanation 3: For any entity x, if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1, and x is involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x) ∧ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 and RAD51 homolog 1 are both involved in homologous recombination repair in humans *)
  shows "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x is either BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∨ RAD51Homolog1 x" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 3 that state if x is BRCA2 or RAD51 homolog 1 and involved in homologous recombination repair, then x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  (* Using explanatory sentence 1 and the premise, we can infer that x is involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "InvolvedInHomologousRecombinationRepairInHumans x" sledgehammer
