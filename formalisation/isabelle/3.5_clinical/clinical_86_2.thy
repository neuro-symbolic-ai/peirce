(* Explanation 1: The unknown PD-L1 status of a patient may affect their eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. UnknownPD_L1Status x ∧ Patient y ∧ EligibilityFor e ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ∧ Affect e ∧ Patient y ∧ PD_L1Status x ∧ EligibilityFor e ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "UnknownPD_L1Status x ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z"
  (* Hypothesis: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
 shows "∃x y z e. UnknownPD_L1Status x ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ∧ AppropriateFor e ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about the unknown PD-L1 status of a patient and their eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "UnknownPD_L1Status x ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states the unknown PD-L1 status of a patient may affect their eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* We can infer that the unknown PD-L1 status affects the eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "UnknownPD_L1Status x ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ∧ Affect e ∧ Patient y ∧ PD_L1Status x ∧ EligibilityFor e ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z" sledgehammer
  (* We are interested in the hypothesis that the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* To prove this, we need to show that there exists an event where the patient is appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* We already have the necessary information about the patient and immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. UnknownPD_L1Status x ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ∧ Affect e ∧ Patient y ∧ PD_L1Status x ∧ EligibilityFor e ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ∧ AppropriateFor e ∧ Patient y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z" <ATP>
