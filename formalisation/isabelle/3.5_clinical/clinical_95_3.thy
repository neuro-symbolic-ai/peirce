(* Explanation 1: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is a necessary condition for a patient to receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. RapidRecovery e ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling x ∧ Patient y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600EMutation z ∧ NecessaryCondition e ∧ ForPatient e y ∧ ReceiveTreatment e y z ∧ WithMutation z x"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient does not receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation, it implies that there was no rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ V600EMutation y ∧ Not(ReceiveTreatment e1 x y) ∧ Implies e2 ∧ NoRapidRecovery e2 x ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling z ∧ NoRapidRecovery e2 z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Drug x ∧ Drug y ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEK y"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
 shows "∃e1 e2. Drug e1 ∧ Drug e2 ∧ Vemurafenib e1 ∧ MEK e2 ∧ Combination e1 e2 ∧ BetterResults e1 ∧ BetterResults e2 ∧ Monotherapy e1"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there are drugs x and y, where x is Vemurafenib and y is MEK. *)
  from asm have "Vemurafenib x" and "MEK y" apply simp
  (* We have the logical proposition that rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is a necessary condition for a patient to receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(B), Not(A)), Implies(Not(patient receives treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation), Not(rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling)) *)
  (* Since we have Vemurafenib x, we can infer that there is no rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling. *)
  then have "Not(RapidRecovery e)" using assms by auto
  (* The hypothesis involves the combination of Vemurafenib and MEK, which can yield better results than Vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  (* We need to show the existence of e1 and e2 such that the desired properties hold. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
