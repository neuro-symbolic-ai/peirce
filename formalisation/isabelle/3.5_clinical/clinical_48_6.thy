(* Explanation 1: Inhibition of PARP directly leads to collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e x y. InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DSB y ⟶ Leads e ∧ Directly e ∧ Cause e x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DSB y"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
 shows "∃e. Results e ∧ Cause e x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Inhibition of PARP, collapsed replication forks, and DSB. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP x ∧ CollapsedReplicationForks y ∧ DSB y" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that Inhibition of PARP directly leads to collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of an event that results in the cause of collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
  then have "∃e. Results e ∧ Cause e x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
