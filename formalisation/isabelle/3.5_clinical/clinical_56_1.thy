axiomatization where

axiomatization where

(* Explanation 3: PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "PALB2 PALB2c"

(* Explanation 4: 1592delT is a pathogenic mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "PathogenicMutation 1592delT"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y)"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y) ∧ PALB2(y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a pathogenic mutation and it is in PALB2. *)
  from asm have "Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y)" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(1592delT is a pathogenic mutation, 1592delT mutated Breast Cancer) *)
  (* Since 1592delT is a pathogenic mutation, it implies 1592delT mutated Breast Cancer. *)
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence 2: 1592delT mutated Breast Cancer. *)
  then have "Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y) ∧ BreastCancer(y)" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1: Patient with PALB2 c. *)
  (* Since the patient is in Breast Cancer and PALB2 is related to Breast Cancer, we can infer PALB2. *)
  then have "∃x y. Patient(x) ∧ PathogenicMutation(y) ∧ In(x, y) ∧ PALB2(y)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
