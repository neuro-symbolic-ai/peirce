(* Explanation 1: If a patient is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they have an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Considered x ∧ PatientWithMutation x y ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ InGene y CTNNB ⟶ Have e ∧ PatientWithMutation x y ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ InGene y CTNNB"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB, then they are considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Patient x ∧ Considered x ∧ PatientWithMutation x y ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ InGene y CTNNB ⟶ AreConsidered e ∧ PatientWithMutation x y ∧ InPathway x CTNNB1"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "ThisPatient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatient e z ∧ ThisPatient z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about ThisPatient z. *)
  from asm have "ThisPatient z" by simp
  (* We have explanatory sentences 1 and 2 which are relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(patient is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB, have an activating mutation in CTNNB) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(patient is considered to be a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB, patient is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway) *)
  (* Both A and B are from explanatory sentence 1, and A and C are from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB and is considered to be in the CTNNB1 pathway. *)
  then have "∃x y. PatientWithMutation z x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ InGene x CTNNB ∧ InPathway z CTNNB1" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis involves drugs targeting the Wnt pathway and effectiveness in the patient. *)
  (* We can introduce the drug, targeting, Wnt pathway, and effectiveness in the patient. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Drug x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective e ∧ InPatient e z ∧ ThisPatient z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
