(* Explanation 1: Being a RAS-regulated cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase implies being a proto-oncogene that plays roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. RASRegulatedCytoplasmicSerineThreonineKinase x ⟶ ProtoOncogene x ∧ PlaysRoles x MAPK_ERK_signaling_pathway"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "BRAF x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRAF is a proto-oncogene that plays important roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway *)
 shows "ProtoOncogene x ∧ PlaysRoles x MAPK_ERK_signaling_pathway"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BRAF is a proto-oncogene. *)
  from asm have "BRAF x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(Being a proto-oncogene, Playing roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway) *)
  (* We can infer that BRAF x is a proto-oncogene that plays roles in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. *)
  then have "ProtoOncogene x ∧ PlaysRoles x MAPK_ERK_signaling_pathway" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
