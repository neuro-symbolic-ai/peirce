(* Explanation 1: If an entity has the mutation W25_H36del, then it is an activating mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Entity x ∧ Mutation y ∧ W25_H36del y ⟶ ActivatingMutation y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ In x y ∧ CTNNB1 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient x is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* We have an explanatory sentence that states if an entity has the mutation W25_H36del, then it is an activating mutation. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition A and B, where Implies(A, B) holds. *)
  (* Since we are looking for an activating mutation, we can infer that if the patient has the mutation W25_H36del, it is an activating mutation. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient x has an activating mutation. *)
  then have "∃y. Mutation y ∧ ActivatingMutation y" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that the activating mutation is in CTNNB1. *)
  (* We do not have direct information about CTNNB1 in the premise or explanations. *)
  (* However, based on the given hypothesis, we can introduce a new variable y representing CTNNB1. *)
  (* Thus, we can conclude that there exists a patient x and a mutation y such that the patient has the mutation, it is an activating mutation, and it is related to CTNNB1. *)
