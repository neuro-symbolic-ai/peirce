(* Explanation 1: Introducing the concept of "PI3KAKT z" is a result of the activation of Akt *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀z. PI3KAKT z ⟶ ActivationOfAkt z"

(* Explanation 2: The concept of "PI3KAKT z" leads to the identification of a target "e" that may inhibit the pathway *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀z e. PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ TargetPathway e z"

(* Explanation 3: The agent "e" responsible for targeting the pathway is related to the entity "x" which represents the kinase inhibitor *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x e. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Target e ∧ TargetPathway e x ∧ Related e x"

(* Explanation 4: The patient "e" involved in the inhibition process is associated with the mutations "y" *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀y e. Mutation y ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 5: The inhibition of the pathway by the target "e" results in the suppression of proliferation and survival in the cellular context *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. Target e ∧ Inhibit e ⟶ (SuppressionProliferation e ∧ SuppressionSurvival e ∧ CellularContext e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z"
  (* Hypothesis: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival *)
 shows "∃x y z e. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ TargetMutation e y ∧ TargetPathway e z ∧ InhibitProliferation e ∧ InhibitSurvival e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about KinaseInhibitor, Mutation, Pathway, and PI3KAKT. *)
  from asm have "KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z" by simp
  (* There are logical relations that can help us infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(Introducing the concept of "PI3KAKT z" is a result of the activation of Akt, The patient "e" involved in the inhibition process is associated with the mutations "y") *)
  (* Both A and D are from the explanation sentences. *)
  (* We can infer TargetMutation e y from the premise. *)
  then have "KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ TargetMutation e y" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, E), Implies(The concept of "PI3KAKT z" leads to the identification of a target "e" that may inhibit the pathway, The inhibition of the pathway by the target "e" results in the suppression of proliferation and survival in the cellular context) *)
  (* Both B and E are from the explanation sentences. *)
  (* We can infer InhibitProliferation e ∧ InhibitSurvival e from the premise. *)
  then have "KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathway z ∧ PI3KAKT z ∧ Target e ∧ Inhibit e ∧ TargetMutation e y ∧ TargetPathway e z ∧ InhibitProliferation e ∧ InhibitSurvival e" <ATP>
