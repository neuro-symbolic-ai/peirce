(* Explanation 1: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: ERBB2 is altered in 13 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. ERBB2 x ∧ Altered y ∧ In y 13"

(* Explanation 3: 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0 *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. BreastCarcinomaPatient x ∧ Percentage y ∧ ERBB2 z ∧ V777L z ∧ Present x z ∧ In x 0 ∧ With x z"

(* Explanation 4: 41% of all breast carcinoma patients *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Percentage x ∧ BreastCarcinomaPatient y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation *)
 shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Known y ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the patient has a mutation. *)
  from asm obtain y where "Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Patient has V777L HER 2 mutation, 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0) *)
  (* Since the patient has the V777L HER 2 mutation, we can infer that 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Percentage 78 ∧ ERBB2 y ∧ V777L y ∧ Present x y ∧ In x 0 ∧ With x y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0, 41% of all breast carcinoma patients) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Known y ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y" <ATP>
