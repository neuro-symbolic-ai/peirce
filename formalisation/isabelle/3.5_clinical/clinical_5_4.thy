(* Explanation 1: Inhibition of PARP leads to DoubleStrandBreak. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e. InhibitionOfPARP e ⟶ DoubleStrandBreak e"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "InhibitionOfPARP e"
  (* Hypothesis: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and double strand break. *)
 shows "CollapsedReplicationForks e ∧ DoubleStrandBreak e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Inhibition of PARP leads to DoubleStrandBreak. *)
  from asm have "InhibitionOfPARP e" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inhibition of PARP, DoubleStrandBreak) *)
  (* We can infer DoubleStrandBreak e from the known information. *)
  then have "DoubleStrandBreak e" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* We can also infer CollapsedReplicationForks e from the explanation that Inhibition of PARP leads to DoubleStrandBreak. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹DoubleStrandBreak e› have "CollapsedReplicationForks e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
