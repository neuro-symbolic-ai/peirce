(* Explanation 1: As the ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. TransportAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ World z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Around y z ⟶ (TypesOfFood w ∧ DistantLocations v ∧ Available w v ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 w)"

(* Explanation 2: As the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. PreserveAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ (TransportAbility z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 z)"

(* Explanation 3: Increasing the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling means increasing the ability to preserve food *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e1 e2. KeepFreshAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟷ (PreserveAbility w ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 w)"

(* Explanation 4: Having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. Variety x ∧ Foods y ∧ Available y z ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ People z ∧ Lives z"

(* Explanation 5: Variety means different kinds or different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x ⟷ (DifferentKinds y ∨ DifferentTypes y)"

(* Explanation 6: Helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e. Helping x ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. Hawaii x ∧ USMainland y ⟶ LocatedFarFrom x y"

(* Explanation 8: Far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y. Far x ⟷ GreatInDistance y"

(* Explanation 9: Distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Distant x ⟷ GreatInDistance y"

(* Explanation 10: The United States of America is a kind of location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. USA x ⟶ Location x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Spoiling w ∧ Transporting e3 ∧ Agent e3 z ∧ LongDistances v ∧ When e2 e3"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ TypesOfFood w ∧ Stores v ∧ Available w v ∧ By e1 e2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the grocery company, fresh foods, and the ability to keep fresh foods from spoiling. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Spoiling w" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 states that increasing the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling means increasing the ability to preserve food. *)
  (* This implies that the ability to preserve food increases, which is related to logical proposition D and C. *)
  then have "PreserveAbility w ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 w" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 states that as the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases. *)
  (* This implies that the ability to transport food increases, which is related to logical proposition C and A. *)
  then have "TransportAbility z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 1 states that as the ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase. *)
  (* This implies that the available types of food in distant locations will increase, which is related to logical proposition A and B. *)
  then have "TypesOfFood w ∧ DistantLocations v ∧ Available w v ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 w" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 4 states that having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  (* This implies that the variety of foods available has a positive impact, which is related to logical proposition E and F. *)
  then have "Variety x ∧ Foods y ∧ Available y z ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ People z ∧ Lives z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 6 states that helping something has a positive impact on that something. *)
  (* This implies that helping has a positive impact, which is related to logical proposition I and J. *)
  then have "Helping x ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 7 states that Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland. *)
  (* This implies that Hawaii is distant, which is related to logical proposition K and N. *)
  then have "Hawaii z ∧ LocatedFarFrom z y" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 9 states that distant means great in distance. *)
  (* This implies that distant is equivalent to great in distance, which is related to logical proposition N and M. *)
  then have "Distant x ⟷ GreatInDistance y" <ATP>
  (* We can now conclude that the new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
