(* Explanation 1: If an object reflects a light of a certain color, then the object appears to be that color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. (Object x ∧ Light y ∧ Color z ∧ Reflect e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Color y) ⟶ (Appear e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z)"

(* Explanation 2: A leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 3: Green is a kind of color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Green x ⟶ Color x"

(* Explanation 4: A leaf is often green in color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y. Leaf x ∧ Green y ∧ Color y ∧ Often x y"

(* Explanation 5: Leaves reflect green light. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y e. Leaves x ∧ Light y ∧ Green y ∧ Reflect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Light y"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
  shows "∃x y e1 e2. Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Appear e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Reflect e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Light y ∧ Green y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about leaves, green, and light. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Light y" by simp
  (* Explanation 5 states that leaves reflect green light, which is related to logical proposition F. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, A), Implies(leaves reflect green light, an object reflects a light of a certain color). *)
  (* From Explanation 5, we can infer that leaves reflect green light. *)
  from explanation_5 obtain e where "Reflect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an object reflects a light of a certain color, the object appears to be that color), *)
  (* we can infer that the object appears to be that color. *)
  from explanation_1 have "Appear e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y" <ATP>
  (* Combine the information to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
