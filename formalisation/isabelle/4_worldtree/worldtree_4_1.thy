(* Explanation 1: Sulfur is yellow in color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Yellow x"

(* Explanation 2: Sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x"

(* Explanation 3: If a sample is yellow and sulfur is known to be yellow, then it is likely that the sample is sulfur. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. (Sample x ∧ Yellow x ∧ KnownToBeYellow y ∧ Sulfur y) ⟶ (LikelyToBeSulfur x ⟶ Sulfur x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x y e. Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Identify y"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x. Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. (Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x) ∧ (LikelyToBeYellow x ⟶ Yellow x)"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know that sulfur is yellow in color. *)
  have sulfur_yellow: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Yellow x" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
  have sulfur_mineral: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x" by (simp add: explanation_2)
  
  (* We need to show that sulfur is a mineral and likely to be yellow implies yellow. *)
  show "∀x. (Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x) ∧ (LikelyToBeYellow x ⟶ Yellow x)"
  proof
    fix x
    show "(Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x) ∧ (LikelyToBeYellow x ⟶ Yellow x)"
    proof
      (* From sulfur_mineral, we have Sulfur x implies Mineral x. *)
      show "Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x" using explanation_2 by auto
      
      (* From the definition of likely to be yellow, we assume it implies yellow. *)
      show "LikelyToBeYellow x ⟶ Yellow x"
      proof
        assume "LikelyToBeYellow x"
        (* Since we don't have a direct axiom for LikelyToBeYellow, we assume it implies Yellow. *)
        show "Yellow x" sledgehammer
