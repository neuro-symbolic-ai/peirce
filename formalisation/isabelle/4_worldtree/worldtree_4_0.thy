(* Explanation 1: Sulfur is yellow in color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Yellow x"

(* Explanation 2: Sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x y e1 e2. Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Identify e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x. Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. (Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x) ∧ LikelyYellow x"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know that sulfur is yellow in color. *)
  have "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Yellow x" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
  have "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x" by (simp add: explanation_2)
  (* We need to show that sulfur is likely to be yellow. *)
  (* Since sulfur is yellow by definition, it is trivially likely to be yellow. *)
  have "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ LikelyYellow x" sledgehammer
  (* Combining the above, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show "∀x. (Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x) ∧ LikelyYellow x" <ATP>
