(* Explanation 1: Usually, people learn how to read and write in school, and activities learned in school are considered learned characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. People x ∧ School y ∧ Activity z ∧ Usually e1 ∧ Learn e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In e1 y ∧ Read z ∧ Write z ∧ Considered e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ LearnedCharacteristic z"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Trait x ⟷ Characteristic x"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics, which are also known as acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. InheritedCharacteristic x ⟷ ¬LearnedCharacteristic x ∧ KnownAs x AcquiredCharacteristic"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied or passed from parent to offspring by genetics or DNA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z e1 e2. InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ Parent y ∧ Offspring z ∧ (Copied e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Source e1 y ∧ Destination e1 z ∧ By e1 Genetics) ∨ (Passed e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Source e2 y ∧ Destination e2 z ∧ By e2 DNA)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∀x. Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about reading. *)
  from asm have "Read x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that activities learned in school are considered learned characteristics. *)
  (* Reading is an activity learned in school, so it is considered a learned characteristic. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
  (* Therefore, a learned characteristic is a learned trait. *)
  have "LearnedCharacteristic x ⟶ LearnedTrait x" sledgehammer
  (* Since reading is a learned characteristic, it follows that it is a learned trait. *)
  then have "LearnedTrait x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
