(* Explanation 1: Sulfur is yellow in color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Yellow x"

(* Explanation 2: Sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x"

(* Explanation 3: If a sample is yellow and sulfur is known to be yellow, then it is likely that the sample is sulfur. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. (Sample x ∧ Yellow x ∧ KnownFor y (Yellow y)) ⟶ (LikelySulfur x ⟶ Sulfur x)"

(* Explanation 4: If something is likely to be yellow, then it is yellow. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. LikelyYellow x ⟶ Yellow x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x y e. Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ Identify y"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x. Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. (Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x) ∧ (LikelyYellow x ⟶ Yellow x)"
