(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers and other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. Animal x ∧ Consumer y ∧ Producers z ∧ FoodChainProcess e1 ∧ HasRole e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Eats e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ (Patient e2 z ∨ Patient e2 y) ∧ (∃e. For e y ∧ Food y)"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlants x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. Food x ∧ Energy y ∧ (Animal z ∨ Plant z) ⟶ (∃e. SourceOf x y ∧ For e z)"

(* Explanation 5: Eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals and living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e1 e2. Eating e1 ∧ Food x ∧ Nutrients y ∧ Energy z ∧ (Animal e2 ∨ LivingThing e2) ⟶ UsedFor e1 (Get y z) ∧ By e1 e2"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e. LivingThing x ∧ Energy y ∧ Require e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ (∃e'. For e' y ∧ For e' Survival)"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. Organism x ∧ Eats e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ (∃e'. SourceOf y x ∧ For e' y)"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀e1 e2. Receive e1 ⟷ (∃x y. e1 = Get x y)"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y e. Herbivore x ∧ Plants y ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"

(* Explanation 12: Mice, being herbivores, primarily obtain their energy directly from plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_12: "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Herbivore x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Obtain e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z ∧ Primarily e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Mice x ∧ In x y ∧ MeadowEcosystem y"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z ∧ In x y ∧ MeadowEcosystem y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about mice in a meadow ecosystem. *)
  from asm have "Mice x ∧ In x y ∧ MeadowEcosystem y" by auto
  (* Explanation 12 states that mice, being herbivores, primarily obtain their energy directly from plants. *)
  (* This directly relates to the hypothesis that mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(K, L) to infer this. *)
  from explanation_12 have "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Herbivore x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Obtain e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z ∧ Primarily e" by blast
  (* Explanation 9 states that receive means get, which is equivalent to obtaining energy. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Equivalent(I, E) to infer this. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z" by (metis explanation_6 explanation_9)
  (* Combine with the known information about the meadow ecosystem. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
