(* Explanation 1: Investigation sometimes requires experimentation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Investigation x ∧ Experimentation y ∧ Requires e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Sometimes e"

(* Explanation 2: Observations and data are a part of the results of an investigation and an experiment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. (Observations x ∧ Data y) ⟶ (PartOf x z ∧ PartOf y z ∧ Results z ∧ (Investigation z ∨ Experiment z))"

(* Explanation 3: Recording observations and data in a journal inherently serves as a method of communicating the results of an investigation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal x ∧ In x y ∧ In x z ∧ Serves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Method e z ∧ Communicating z ∧ Results z ∧ Investigation z ∧ Inherently e"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Using e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Determine e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ RelativePH e2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal x ∧ In x y ∧ In x z ∧ Communicates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Results z ∧ Investigation z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about Alan using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of household solutions. *)
  from asm have "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Using e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Determine e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ RelativePH e2 z" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 provides a direct implication about recording observations and data in a journal serving as a method of communicating the results of an investigation. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(F, G) from Explanation 3. *)
  (* F: recording observations and data in a journal, G: method of communicating the results of an investigation *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal x ∧ In x y ∧ In x z ∧ Serves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Method e z ∧ Communicating z ∧ Results z ∧ Investigation z ∧ Inherently e" by blast
  (* We need to show that recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal x ∧ In x y ∧ In x z ∧ Communicates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Results z ∧ Investigation z" sledgehammer
