(* Explanation 1: As the ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. TransportAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ World z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Around y z ⟶ (TypesOfFood e2 ∧ DistantLocations e2 ∧ Increase e2)"

(* Explanation 2: As the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. PreserveAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ (TransportAbility y ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x)"

(* Explanation 3: To preserve food means to have the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PreserveFood x ⟷ AbilityToKeepFresh y ∧ Food y ∧ FromSpoiling y"

(* Explanation 4: Having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. VarietyOfFoods x ∧ Available x ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ On e y ∧ People y ∧ Lives y"

(* Explanation 5: Variety means different kinds or different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x ⟷ (DifferentKinds y ∨ DifferentTypes y)"

(* Explanation 6: Helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x e. Helping x ⟶ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ On e x"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. Hawaii x ∧ USMainland y ⟶ LocatedFarFrom x y"

(* Explanation 8: Far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x. Far x ⟷ GreatInDistance x"

(* Explanation 9: Distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x. Distant x ⟷ GreatInDistance x"

(* Explanation 10: The United States of America is a kind of location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. USA x ⟶ Location x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ FromSpoiling z ∧ Transporting e2 ∧ LongDistances e2"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ TypesOfFood e2 ∧ AvailableInStores e2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the grocery company, way, fresh foods, and the ability to keep fresh foods from spoiling. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ FromSpoiling z ∧ Transporting e2 ∧ LongDistances e2" by meson
  
  (* Explanation 3 and the premise give us the equivalence between preserving food and the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling. *)
  (* We can infer that the ability to preserve food increases. *)
  then have "PreserveAbility z" sledgehammer
  
  (* From the derived implications, we know that the ability to preserve food increases implies the ability to transport food increases. *)
  then have "TransportAbility z" <ATP>
  
  (* From the derived implications, the ability to transport food increases implies the available types of food in distant locations will increase. *)
  then have "TypesOfFood e2 ∧ DistantLocations e2 ∧ Increase e2" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 4 states that having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  (* We can infer that increasing the types of food available in stores will have a positive impact. *)
  then have "PositiveImpact e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ On e2 y ∧ People y ∧ Lives y" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 6 states that helping something has a positive impact on that something. *)
  (* We can infer that this new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  then have "Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ TypesOfFood e2 ∧ AvailableInStores e2" <ATP>
  
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
