(* Explanation 1: As the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling increases, it directly enhances the methods and technologies used to preserve food, leading to the development of new technology for food preservation and transportation, which can be applied to distant locations like Hawaii *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. Ability x ∧ Food y ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Keep e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Increases e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Enhance e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e3 y ∧ Preserve e4 ∧ Agent e4 y ∧ Technology z ∧ Development e4 ∧ Agent e4 z ∧ Apply e4 ∧ Patient e4 z ∧ Location z"

(* Explanation 2: Improved preservation methods directly enhance the ability to transport food over long distances without spoilage, ensuring that food remains fresh during transportation, and this is particularly beneficial for distant locations such as Hawaii *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. PreservationMethods x ∧ Ability y ∧ Transport e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Food z ∧ Spoilage z ∧ Enhance e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Ensure e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Fresh z ∧ During z e1 ∧ Beneficial e3 ∧ Location z"

(* Explanation 3: As the ability to transport food over long distances increases, the variety and types of food available in distant locations, such as Hawaii, also increase, due to the application of new technology *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Ability x ∧ Transport e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Food y ∧ Location z ∧ Increases e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Variety y ∧ Available y z ∧ Technology z ∧ Application e2 ∧ Agent e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Having a greater variety of foods available in stores positively impacts people's lives by providing more dietary options and nutritional benefits, especially in locations like Hawaii where food variety is limited *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. Variety x ∧ Food y ∧ Store z ∧ Available y z ∧ Impact e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ People z ∧ Provide e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Options y ∧ Benefits y ∧ Location z ∧ Limited y"

(* Explanation 5: Variety in food availability means having different kinds or types of foods accessible to consumers, which is enhanced by new transportation technologies *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e1. Variety x ∧ Food y ∧ Availability z ⟷ Accessible y z ∧ Consumer z ∧ Enhance e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Technology z"

(* Explanation 6: Helping to increase the variety of foods available in stores has a positive impact on the local community by improving access to diverse food options, particularly in distant locations like Hawaii *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∃x y z e1 e2. Help e1 ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Variety y ∧ Food y ∧ Store z ∧ Available y z ∧ Impact e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Community z ∧ Improve e2 ∧ Access y ∧ Options y ∧ Location z"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland, which makes it a distant location in terms of food transportation, and thus benefits significantly from advancements in food transportation technology *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∃x y z e1 e2. Hawaii x ∧ Location y ∧ Mainland z ∧ Located e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ FarFrom y z ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Location z ∧ Transportation z ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Advancement z ∧ Technology z"

(* Explanation 8: The term "far" refers to a great distance, which is relevant when considering the transportation of goods to distant locations like Hawaii, where new technology can mitigate distance challenges *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∃x y z e1 e2. Term x ∧ Far x ∧ Distance y ∧ Refer e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Relevant e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Transportation z ∧ Goods z ∧ Location z ∧ Technology z ∧ Mitigate e2 ∧ Challenges y"

(* Explanation 9: The United States of America is considered a kind of location, which includes both the mainland and distant states like Hawaii, where new food transportation technologies can increase food variety *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∃x y z e1 e2. USA x ∧ Location y ∧ Consider e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Include e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Mainland z ∧ State z ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Technology z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Variety y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "Company x ∧ Grocery x ∧ Way y ∧ Find e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Food z ∧ Fresh z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transport e3 ∧ Agent e3 y ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ LongDistance z"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the company, grocery, way, and the ability to keep fresh foods from spoiling over long distances. *)
  from asm have "Company x ∧ Grocery x ∧ Way y ∧ Find e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Food z ∧ Fresh z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transport e3 ∧ Agent e3 y ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ LongDistance z" by auto
  (* The ability to keep fresh food from spoiling implies the development of new technology for food preservation and transportation. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(A, C). *)
  then have "∃x. Technology x" using explanation_3 by blast
  (* The development of new technology for food preservation and transportation implies the ability to transport food over long distances without spoilage. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(C, D). *)
  then have "∃x. Ability x ∧ Transport e3" using assms explanation_3 by blast
  (* The ability to transport food over long distances without spoilage implies a variety and types of food available in distant locations. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(D, F). *)
  then have "∃x. Variety x" using explanation_3 by blast
  (* The variety and types of food available in distant locations imply a greater variety of foods available in stores. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(F, G). *)
  then have "∃x. Store x ∧ Available x" sledgehammer
  (* A greater variety of foods available in stores implies a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(G, H). *)
  then have "∃x. People x ∧ Impact e1" sledgehammer
  (* Hawaii is a distant location, which implies advancements in food transportation technology. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(L, M). *)
  then have "∃x. Hawaii x ∧ Advancement x" <ATP>
  (* Advancements in food transportation technology imply a greater variety of foods available in stores. *)
  (* This is supported by the logical relation Implies(M, G). *)
  then have "∃x. Store x ∧ Available x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, this new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
