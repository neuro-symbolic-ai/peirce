(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers; other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. Animal x ∧ Consumer y ∧ Producers z ∧ Food z ∧ HasRole e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ (Eat e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z)"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlants x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals; plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. Food x ∧ Energy y ∧ (Animal z ∨ Plant z) ⟶ SourceOf y z"

(* Explanation 5: Eating; taking in food is used to get nutrients; energy by animals; living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e1 e2. Eating e1 ∧ Food x ∧ Nutrients y ∧ Energy z ∧ (Animal e2 ∨ LivingThing e2) ⟶ (Use e1 ∧ Agent e1 e2 ∧ Purpose e1 y ∧ Purpose e1 z)"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e. LivingThing x ∧ Energy y ∧ Require e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Purpose e Survival"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. (Organism x ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y) ⟶ SourceOf y x"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀e1 e2. Receive e1 ⟷ Get e2"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y e. Herbivore x ∧ Plant y ⟶ (Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y)"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Mice x ∧ MeadowEcosystem e"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plant z ∧ MeadowEcosystem e ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z ∧ In x e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about mice and the meadow ecosystem. *)
  from asm have "Mice x ∧ MeadowEcosystem e" by simp
  (* From explanation 11, we know that a mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
  then have "Herbivore x" sledgehammer
  (* From explanation 10, we know that herbivores only eat plants. *)
  then obtain z where "Plant z ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z" <ATP>
  (* From explanation 8, if an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
  then have "SourceOf z x" <ATP>
  (* From explanation 4, food is a source of energy for animals. *)
  then have "Energy y ∧ SourceOf y x" <ATP>
  (* From explanation 9, receive means get. *)
  then have "Receive e" <ATP>
  (* We have all the necessary components to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
