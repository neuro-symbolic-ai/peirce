(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers and other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. Animal x ∧ Consumer y ∧ Producers z ∧ FoodChainProcess e1 ∧ HasRole e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Eats e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ (∃e. For e y ∧ Food y)"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlants x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Food x ⟶ (EnergySource x ∧ (∃e. For e y) ∧ (Animal y ∨ Plant y))"

(* Explanation 5: Eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals and living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e. Eating x ∧ Food y ∧ Nutrients z ∧ Energy z ∧ Used e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ToGet e z ∧ By x y ∧ (Animal y ∨ LivingThing y)"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThing x ⟶ (∃e. Require e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Energy y ∧ For e y)"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. (Organism x ∧ Eats e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y) ⟶ (FoodSource y ∧ To y x)"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀e1 e2. Receive e1 ⟷ Get e2"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y e. Herbivore x ⟶ (Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Plant y)"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"

(* Explanation 12: Mice, being herbivores, primarily obtain their energy directly from plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_12: "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Herbivore x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Obtain e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Mice x ∧ In x y ∧ MeadowEcosystem y"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z ∧ In x y ∧ MeadowEcosystem y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about mice in a meadow ecosystem. *)
  from asm have "Mice x ∧ In x y ∧ MeadowEcosystem y" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 11 states that a mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
  (* Explanation 12 states that mice, being herbivores, primarily obtain their energy directly from plants. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(K, L) to infer that mice primarily obtain their energy directly from plants. *)
  from explanation_11 have "Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x" <ATP>
  from explanation_12 have "∃x y z e. Mice x ∧ Herbivore x ∧ Energy y ∧ Plants z ∧ Obtain e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ From y z" <ATP>
  (* Since receive means get, we can use explanation 9 to equate obtain with receive. *)
  from explanation_9 have "Receive e ⟷ Get e" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that in a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
