(* Explanation 1: Usually people learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. People x ∧ School y ∧ Read z ∧ Write z ∧ Learn e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In x y ∧ Usually e2 ∧ Agent e2 x"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Trait x ⟷ Characteristic x"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. InheritedCharacteristic x ⟷ ¬(LearnedCharacteristic x ∨ AcquiredCharacteristic x)"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z e1 e2. Inheriting e1 ∧ InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ Copied e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Passed e1 ∧ Parent y ∧ Offspring z ∧ ByGenetics e1 ∧ ByDNA e1"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∀x. Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about reading. *)
  from asm have "Read x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that usually people learn how to read and write in school. *)
  (* This implies that reading is a learned activity, which can be considered a learned characteristic. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics. *)
  (* Therefore, if reading is learned, it cannot be inherited, and thus it is a learned trait. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristic x" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 states that trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
  (* Therefore, a learned characteristic is equivalent to a learned trait. *)
  then have "LearnedTrait x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
