(* Explanation 1: as ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. TransportAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ World z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Around y z ⟶ (TypesOfFood w ∧ DistantLocations v ∧ Available w v ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 w)"

(* Explanation 2: as ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. PreserveAbility x ∧ Food y ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ (TransportAbility z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 z)"

(* Explanation 3: to preserve food means to keep fresh food from spoiling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e1 e2 x y. Preserve e1 ∧ Food x ⟷ (Keep e2 ∧ Fresh x ∧ Food x ∧ Spoiling y ∧ From e2 y)"

(* Explanation 4: having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. Variety x ∧ Food y ∧ Available y z ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ People z ∧ Lives z"

(* Explanation 5: variety means different kinds; different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x ⟷ (DifferentKinds y ∨ DifferentTypes y)"

(* Explanation 6: helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e1 e2. Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ (PositiveImpact e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y)"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. Hawaii x ∧ UnitedStatesMainland y ⟶ Located x ∧ FarFrom x y"

(* Explanation 8: far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y. Far x ⟷ GreatInDistance y"

(* Explanation 9: distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Distant x ⟷ GreatInDistance y"

(* Explanation 10: the United States of America is a kind of location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. UnitedStatesOfAmerica x ⟶ Location x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Spoiling w ∧ From e2 w ∧ Transport e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ LongDistances v ∧ When e3 v"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ TypesOfFood w ∧ Stores v ∧ Available w v ∧ By e1 e2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the grocery company, fresh foods, and the process of keeping them from spoiling. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Spoiling w ∧ From e2 w ∧ Transport e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ LongDistances v ∧ When e3 v" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 3 states that preserving food means keeping fresh food from spoiling. *)
  (* This aligns with the premise, allowing us to infer the ability to preserve food. *)
  have "PreserveAbility x" sledgehammer
  
  (* Explanation 2 states that as the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases. *)
  (* We can infer the ability to transport food from the ability to preserve food. *)
  then have "TransportAbility x" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that as the ability to transport food increases, the available types of food in distant locations will increase. *)
  (* We can infer the increase in available types of food in distant locations. *)
  then have "TypesOfFood w ∧ DistantLocations v ∧ Available w v ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 w" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 6 states that helping something has a positive impact on that something. *)
  (* We can infer that this new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  have "Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ TypesOfFood w ∧ Stores v ∧ Available w v ∧ By e1 e2" <ATP>
  
  (* We need to show that this new technology might help people in Hawaii. *)
  (* Explanation 7 states that Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland. *)
  (* Explanation 9 states that distant means great in distance. *)
  (* We can infer that Hawaii is a distant location, and thus the increase in types of food available will help people in Hawaii. *)
  have "Hawaii z" <ATP>
  
  (* Finally, we conclude that the new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
