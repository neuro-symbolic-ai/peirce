(* Explanation 1: Investigation sometimes requires experimentation, and experimentation often involves recording observations and data. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1_1: "∃x y e. Investigation x ∧ Experimentation y ∧ Requires e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" and
  explanation_1_2: "∃x y z e. Experimentation x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Recording e ∧ Involves e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 2: Observations and data are a part of the results of an investigation and an experiment, and recording them in a journal is a method of documenting these results. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2_1: "∀x y z. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Investigation z ∧ Experiment z ⟶ PartOf x z ∧ PartOf y z" and
  explanation_2_2: "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Recording e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Documenting e ∧ Results e"

(* Explanation 3: Recording observations and data in a journal inherently serves as a method of communicating the results of an investigation, and this act directly results in the communication of these results. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3_1: "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Recording e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Communicating e ∧ Results e" and
  explanation_3_2: "∃e. Act e ∧ Results e ∧ Communication e"

(* Explanation 4: The act of documenting observations and data in a journal ensures that the results of an investigation are communicated effectively, as it provides a clear and organized record that can be shared with others. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4_1: "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Documenting e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Ensures e ∧ Results e ∧ Investigation x ∧ Communicated e" and
  explanation_4_2: "∃x y e. Record x ∧ Clear x ∧ Organized x ∧ Provides e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ Shared x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative ph of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Determine e ∧ RelativePH z"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Recording e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Communicates e ∧ Results e ∧ Investigation x"
proof -
  (* From the logical relations and derived implications, we can infer the necessary steps to prove the hypothesis. *)
  (* We need to show that recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  
  (* From explanation_3_1, we have that recording observations and data in a journal serves as a method of communicating results. *)
  from explanation_3_1 have "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Recording e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Communicating e ∧ Results e" by blast
  
  (* From explanation_2_1, we know that observations and data are part of the results of an investigation. *)
  from explanation_2_1 have "∀x y z. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Investigation z ⟶ PartOf x z ∧ PartOf y z" sledgehammer
  
  (* Using the derived implication Implies(C, G), we can infer that observations and data being part of the results of an investigation implies that recording them in a journal results in the communication of results. *)
  from `∀x y z. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Investigation z ⟶ PartOf x z ∧ PartOf y z` and explanation_3_1
  have "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Recording e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Communicates e ∧ Results e ∧ Investigation x" <ATP>
