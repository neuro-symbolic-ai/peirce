(* Explanation 1: greatest means largest; highest; most. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Greatest x y ⟷ (Largest x y ∨ Highest x y ∨ Most x y)"

(* Explanation 2: the amount of daylight is least in the winter. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. AmountOfDaylight x ∧ Least x ∧ In e x ∧ Winter e"

(* Explanation 3: winter is when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. Winter e ⟶ (Hemisphere y ∧ Sun z ∧ Tilted e ∧ Agent e y ∧ AwayFrom y z)"

(* Explanation 4: Alaska is a state located in the United States of America. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Alaska x ⟶ (State x ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ UnitedStatesOfAmerica y)"

(* Explanation 5: United States is located in the northern hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. UnitedStates x ⟶ (LocatedIn x y ∧ NorthernHemisphere y)"

(* Explanation 6: the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∃x y e1 e2. Earth x ∧ Axis y ∧ Tilted e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ On x y ∧ Causes e1 e2 ∧ Seasons e2"

(* Explanation 7: the amount of daylight is greatest in the summer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∃x y e. AmountOfDaylight x ∧ Greatest x y ∧ In e x ∧ Summer e"

(* Explanation 8: winter is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀e. Winter e ⟶ Season e"

(* Explanation 9: summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀e. Summer e ⟶ Season e"

(* Explanation 10: amount is a property of something and includes ordered values of none; least; little; some; half; much; many; most; all. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Amount x ⟶ (PropertyOf x y ∧ Includes x y ∧ OrderedValues y)"

(* Explanation 11: fewer means lower; less in number. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x y. Fewer x y ⟷ (Lower x y ∨ LessInNumber x y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: in alaska, there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter than in the summer. *)
  assumes asm: "Alaska x ∧ HoursOfDaylight y ∧ Winter e1 ∧ Summer e2 ∧ Fewer y x ∧ In e1 y ∧ In e2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  shows "∃x y e. NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Winter e ∧ Tilted e ∧ Agent e x ∧ AwayFrom x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Alaska, hours of daylight, winter, summer, and fewer hours of daylight in winter than in summer. *)
  from asm have "Alaska x ∧ Winter e1 ∧ Summer e2 ∧ Fewer y x" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 5 states that the United States is located in the northern hemisphere. *)
  (* Explanation 4 states that Alaska is a state located in the United States of America. *)
  (* From these, we can infer that Alaska is in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  from explanation_4 and explanation_5 have "NorthernHemisphere x" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 3 states that winter is when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  from explanation_3 have "Winter e1 ⟶ (Hemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Tilted e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ AwayFrom x y)" <ATP>
  (* Since we have Winter e1 from the premise, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Hemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Tilted e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ AwayFrom x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
