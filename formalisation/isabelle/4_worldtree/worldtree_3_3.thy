(* Explanation 1: All hurricanes have high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Hurricane x ⟶ (Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e)"

(* Explanation 2: All tornadoes have high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Tornado x ⟶ (Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e)"

(* Explanation 3: High wind speeds imply high winds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e. HighWindSpeeds e ⟶ HighWinds e"

(* Explanation 4: If an event involves high winds, then hurricanes and tornadoes can be agents in such events. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀e x. (Involves e ∧ HighWinds e) ⟶ ((Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x) ∧ Agent e x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x"
  (* Hypothesis: Both hurricanes and tornadoes always have high winds. *)
  shows "∀x e. (Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x) ⟶ (Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e)"
