(* Explanation 1: As the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling increases, it directly enhances the methods and technologies used to preserve food, leading to the development of new technology for food preservation and transportation, which can be applied to distant locations like Hawaii. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. Ability x ∧ Food y ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Enhance e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Methods y ∧ Technologies z ∧ Preserve e3 ∧ Agent e3 y ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ Development e4 ∧ Technology z ∧ Apply e4 ∧ Location e4 z x ∧ Hawaii x"

(* Explanation 2: Improved preservation methods directly enhance the ability to transport food over long distances without spoilage, ensuring that food remains fresh during transportation, and this is particularly beneficial for distant locations such as Hawaii. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. Methods x ∧ Preservation y ∧ Enhance e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Ability y ∧ Transport e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Food z ∧ LongDistances z ∧ Spoilage z ∧ Ensure e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Fresh z ∧ Transportation z ∧ Beneficial z x ∧ Hawaii x"

(* Explanation 3: As the ability to transport food over long distances increases, the variety and types of food available in distant locations, such as Hawaii, also increase, due to the application of new technology. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Ability x ∧ Transport y ∧ Food z ∧ LongDistances z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Variety z ∧ Types z ∧ Available z ∧ Locations z x ∧ Hawaii x ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Application z ∧ Technology z"

(* Explanation 4: Having a greater variety of foods available in stores positively impacts people's lives by providing more dietary options and nutritional benefits, especially in locations like Hawaii where food variety is limited. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. Variety x ∧ Foods y ∧ Available y ∧ Stores z ∧ Impact e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Lives y ∧ Provide e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Options y ∧ Benefits y ∧ Locations z x ∧ Hawaii x ∧ Limited y"

(* Explanation 5: This impact is facilitated by advancements in food transportation technology. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y e. Impact x ∧ Facilitate e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Advancements y ∧ Technology y"

(* Explanation 6: Variety in food availability means having different kinds or types of foods accessible to consumers, which is enhanced by new transportation technologies. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y z e1 e2. Variety x ∧ Availability y ∧ Means e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Types y ∧ Foods z ∧ Accessible z ∧ Consumers z ∧ Enhance e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Technologies y"

(* Explanation 7: Helping to increase the variety of foods available in stores has a positive impact on the local community by improving access to diverse food options, particularly in distant locations like Hawaii. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∃x y z e1 e2. Help e1 ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Variety y ∧ Foods z ∧ Available z ∧ Stores z ∧ Impact e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Community y ∧ Improve e2 ∧ Access y ∧ Options z ∧ Locations z x ∧ Hawaii x"

(* Explanation 8: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland, which makes it a distant location in terms of food transportation, and thus benefits significantly from advancements in food transportation technology. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∃x y z e1 e2. Hawaii x ∧ Located e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Mainland y ∧ FarFrom x y ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Location e2 z x ∧ Hawaii x ∧ Transportation z ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ Advancements y ∧ Technology y"

(* Explanation 9: The term "far" refers to a great distance, which is relevant when considering the transportation of goods to distant locations like Hawaii, where new technology can mitigate distance challenges. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∃x y z e1 e2. Term x ∧ Far x ∧ Refers e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Distance y ∧ Relevant y ∧ Consider e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Transportation z ∧ Goods z ∧ Locations z x ∧ Hawaii x ∧ Mitigate e2 ∧ Technology y ∧ Challenges z"

(* Explanation 10: The United States of America is considered a kind of location, which includes both the mainland and distant states like Hawaii, where new food transportation technologies can increase food variety. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∃x y z e1 e2. USA x ∧ Consider e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Location e1 y x ∧ Hawaii x ∧ Include e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Mainland y ∧ States z ∧ Locations z x ∧ Hawaii x ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Technology y ∧ Variety z"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances. *)
  assumes asm: "Company x ∧ Grocery y ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Way z ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Foods y ∧ Fresh y ∧ Spoiling y ∧ Transport e2 ∧ LongDistances y"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the company, grocery, and transportation over long distances. *)
  from asm have "Company x ∧ Grocery y ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Way z ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Foods y ∧ Fresh y ∧ Spoiling y ∧ Transport e2 ∧ LongDistances y" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 1 and the logical relation Implies(A, B) suggest that an increase in the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling leads to the development of new technology. *)
  (* Explanation 2 and the logical relation Implies(C, D) suggest that improved preservation methods enhance the ability to transport food over long distances. *)
  (* Explanation 3 and the logical relation Implies(D, E) suggest that the ability to transport food over long distances increases the variety and types of food available in distant locations. *)
  (* Explanation 4 and the logical relation Implies(E, F) suggest that an increase in food variety in distant locations leads to a greater variety of foods available in stores. *)
  (* Explanation 7 and the logical relation Implies(I, J) suggest that variety in food availability positively impacts the local community by improving access to diverse food options. *)
  (* Explanation 8 and the logical relation Implies(K, L) suggest that Hawaii, being a distant location, benefits from new technology that mitigates distance challenges. *)
  (* From these explanations and logical relations, we can infer that the new technology helps people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  then have "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
