(* Explanation 1: As the ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. AbilityToTransportFood x ∧ World y ∧ DistantLocations z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Around x y ⟶ Increase e2 ∧ TypesOfFood w ∧ AvailableIn w z"

(* Explanation 2: As the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. AbilityToPreserveFood x ∧ AbilityToTransportFood y ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 y"

(* Explanation 3: Increasing the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling leads to an increase in the ability to preserve food *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e1 e2. AbilityToKeepFreshFood x ∧ Spoiling y ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ Increase e2 ∧ AbilityToPreserveFood z ∧ Agent e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. VarietyOfFoods x ∧ Available x ∧ PositiveImpact e ∧ Agent e x ∧ On e y ∧ People y"

(* Explanation 5: Variety means different kinds or different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x ⟷ (DifferentKinds y ∨ DifferentTypes y)"

(* Explanation 6: Helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x e1 e2. Helping e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ⟶ PositiveImpact e2 ∧ Agent e2 x"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. Hawaii x ∧ USMainland y ⟶ LocatedFarFrom x y"

(* Explanation 8: Far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x. Far x ⟷ GreatInDistance x"

(* Explanation 9: Distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x. Distant x ⟷ GreatInDistance x"

(* Explanation 10: The United States of America is a kind of location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. USA x ⟶ Location x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transporting e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ LongDistances z"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Technology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ TypesOfFood w ∧ AvailableInStores w"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the grocery company, way, fresh foods, and their transportation over long distances. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Found e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Keep e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transporting e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ LongDistances z" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 3 states that increasing the ability to keep fresh food from spoiling leads to an increase in the ability to preserve food. *)
  (* We can infer that the ability to preserve food increases. *)
  then have "Increase e4 ∧ AbilityToPreserveFood a ∧ Agent e4 a" sledgehammer
  
  (* Explanation 2 states that as the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases. *)
  (* We can infer that the ability to transport food increases. *)
  then have "Increase e5 ∧ AbilityToTransportFood b ∧ Agent e5 b" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that as the ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase. *)
  (* We can infer that the available types of food in distant locations increase. *)
  then have "Increase e6 ∧ TypesOfFood w ∧ AvailableIn w z" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 6 states that helping something has a positive impact on that something. *)
  (* We can infer that this new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  then have "Help e7 ∧ Agent e7 x ∧ Patient e7 y ∧ In y z" <ATP>
  
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
