(* Explanation 1: A hurricane has high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Hurricane x ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e"

(* Explanation 2: A tornado has high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. Tornado x ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x"
  (* Hypothesis: Both hurricanes and tornadoes always have high winds. *)
  shows "∀x e. (Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x) ⟶ (Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e)"
proof -
  (* We start by considering the cases for Hurricane and Tornado separately. *)
  {
    assume "Hurricane x"
    (* From Explanation 1, we know that a hurricane has high wind speeds. *)
    from explanation_1 obtain e where "Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e" sledgehammer
    (* We need to show that this implies high winds. *)
    (* Assuming HighWindSpeeds implies HighWinds, we can conclude: *)
    have "HighWinds e" <ATP>
    hence "Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e" <ATP>
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume "Tornado x"
    (* From Explanation 2, we know that a tornado has high wind speeds. *)
    from explanation_2 obtain e where "Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e" <ATP>
    (* We need to show that this implies high winds. *)
    (* Assuming HighWindSpeeds implies HighWinds, we can conclude: *)
    have "HighWinds e" <ATP>
    hence "Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e" <ATP>
  }
  ultimately show ?thesis <ATP>
