(* Explanation 1: A hurricane has high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Hurricane x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x"

(* Explanation 2: A tornado has high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. Tornado x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x"

(* Explanation 3: High wind speeds imply high winds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e1 e2. HighWindSpeeds e1 ⟶ (HighWinds e2 ∧ Imply e1 e2)"

(* Explanation 4: Hurricanes and tornadoes can both be agents in events involving high winds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x e. (Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x) ⟶ (Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x"
  (* Hypothesis: Both hurricanes and tornadoes always have high winds. *)
  shows "∀x e. (Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x) ⟶ (Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e)"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x. *)
  from asm have "Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x" by auto
  (* We have logical relations Implies(A, C) and Implies(B, C), which imply high wind speeds for both hurricanes and tornadoes. *)
  (* From explanation_1 and explanation_2, we know that both hurricanes and tornadoes have high wind speeds. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x e. Hurricane x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x" by auto
  from explanation_2 have "∃x e. Tornado x ∧ HighWindSpeeds e ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x" by auto
  (* Using explanation_3, high wind speeds imply high winds. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∀e1 e2. HighWindSpeeds e1 ⟶ (HighWinds e2 ∧ Imply e1 e2)" by simp
  (* Therefore, both hurricanes and tornadoes have high winds. *)
  (* Using explanation_4, hurricanes and tornadoes can both be agents in events involving high winds. *)
  from explanation_4 have "∀x e. (Hurricane x ∨ Tornado x) ⟶ (Agent e x ∧ HighWinds e)" by blast
  (* We can conclude that both hurricanes and tornadoes always have high winds. *)
