(* Explanation 1: Usually, people learn how to read and write in school, and activities learned in school are considered learned characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. People x ∧ School y ∧ Activity z ∧ Learn e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In z y ∧ (Read z ∨ Write z) ∧ Considered e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ LearnedCharacteristic z"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Trait x ⟷ Characteristic y"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. InheritedCharacteristic x ⟷ ¬LearnedCharacteristic y"

(* Explanation 4: Learned characteristics are also known as acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. LearnedCharacteristic x ⟷ AcquiredCharacteristic y"

(* Explanation 5: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied or passed from parent to offspring by genetics or DNA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e1 e2. InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ Parent y ∧ Offspring z ∧ (Copy e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Source e1 y ∧ Destination e1 z ∧ By e1 Genetics) ∨ (Pass e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Source e2 y ∧ Destination e2 z ∧ By e2 DNA)"

(* Explanation 6: Learned characteristics are synonymous with learned traits. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LearnedCharacteristic x ⟷ LearnedTrait y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∀x. Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x"
