(* Explanation 1: A hurricane has high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Hurricane x ∧ HighWindSpeeds y ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: A tornado has high wind speeds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Tornado x ∧ HighWindSpeeds y ∧ Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: High wind speeds imply high winds. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. HighWindSpeeds x ⟶ HighWinds y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Hurricane x ∨ Tornado y"
  (* Hypothesis: Both hurricanes and tornadoes always have high winds. *)
  shows "∀x y z e. (Hurricane x ∨ Tornado y) ∧ HighWinds z ⟶ Have e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that either a hurricane or a tornado is present. *)
  from asm have "Hurricane x ∨ Tornado y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 and 2 tell us that both hurricanes and tornadoes have high wind speeds. *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides the logical relation that high wind speeds imply high winds. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that both hurricanes and tornadoes have high winds. *)
  have "HighWindSpeeds x ⟶ HighWinds x" by (simp add: explanation_3)
  have "HighWindSpeeds y ⟶ HighWinds y" using explanation_3 by auto
  (* Since hurricanes and tornadoes have high wind speeds, they also have high winds. *)
  then have "HighWinds x ∧ HighWinds y" using explanation_2 explanation_3 by blast
  (* We need to show that if there are high winds, then there is an event where both hurricanes and tornadoes are agents and high winds are the patient. *)
