(* Explanation 1: Clinical Trial NCT03568656 has mutation in CBP as eligibility criteria for mutation arm. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e. ClinicalTrial x ∧ NCT03568656 x ∧ Mutation y ∧ CBP z ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ EligibilityCriteriaFor y w ∧ MutationArm w"

(* Explanation 2: CBP is another name for CREBBP. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. CBP x ∧ CREBBP y ⟶ AnotherNameFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "NCT03568656 x ∧ CREBBP y"
  (* Hypothesis: NCT03568656 targets CREBBP. *)
  shows "∃x y e. NCT03568656 x ∧ CREBBP y ∧ Targets e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about NCT03568656 and CREBBP. *)
  from asm have "NCT03568656 x ∧ CREBBP y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides information about NCT03568656 having mutation in CBP as eligibility criteria for mutation arm. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that CBP is another name for CREBBP. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to relate CBP and CREBBP. *)
  from explanation_2 have "CBP z ⟶ AnotherNameFor z y" using assms by blast
  (* Since CBP is another name for CREBBP, we can infer that the mutation in CBP is related to CREBBP. *)
  (* Explanation 1 implies that NCT03568656 has mutation in CBP, which is related to CREBBP. *)
  (* Therefore, NCT03568656 targets CREBBP. *)
  then have "Targets e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
