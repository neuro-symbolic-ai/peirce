(* Explanation 1: Patient has a V777L HER 2 mutation, which is a specific mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y ∧ Specific y"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient has a specific mutation, such as V777L HER 2, it is considered a known mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Specific y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ Known y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has x y"
