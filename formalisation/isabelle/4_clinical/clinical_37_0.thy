(* Explanation 1: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257 study is only in Canada. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. CFI402257Study x ∧ Canada y ∧ In x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
  shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Travel e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ¬Suitable x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 suggests that CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y. CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y" by meson
  (* Explanation 2 suggests that CFI-402257 study is only in Canada. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y. CFI402257Study x ∧ Canada y ∧ In x y" by auto
  (* Since the study is only in Canada, the patient will have to travel if they are not in Canada. *)
  (* We assume the patient is not in Canada, hence they will have to travel. *)
  have "Travel e ∧ Agent e x" sledgehammer
  (* Since the patient has to travel, it may not be suitable for them. *)
  have "¬Suitable x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
