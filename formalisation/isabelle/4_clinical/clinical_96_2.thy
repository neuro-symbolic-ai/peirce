(* Explanation 1: Patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600EMutation y ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e1 e2 v. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ BRAF_V600EKinase z ∧ ATPBindingSite w ∧ LowMolecularWeight y ∧ OrallyAvailable y ∧ Bind e1 ∧ Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PatientEvent e1 w ∧ Selectively e1 ∧ To w z ∧ Activity v ∧ PatientEvent e2 v"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600EMutation y ∧ Candidate x ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib w ∧ With z w ∧ For x z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ V600EMutation w"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ V600EMutation w ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y w"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and V600E mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ V600EMutation w" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib) *)
  (* From the known information and explanation 3, we can infer that the patient is a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  then have "∃y z. Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ With y z ∧ For y w" sledgehammer
  (* We can now conclude that the patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
