(* Explanation 1: A patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer has breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ CharacterizedBy y z ∧ Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER z ∧ ¬Has y z"

(* Explanation 2: Triple Negative Breast Cancer is defined by the lack of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ⟶ (∀y. DefinedBy x y ⟶ Expression y ∧ ER y ∧ PR y ∧ HER2 y ⟶ ¬Has x y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ ¬Has y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 states that Triple Negative Breast Cancer is defined by the lack of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), which means a patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer is equivalent to the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
  (* Since we have BreastCancer y, we can use Explanation 2 to infer the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
  then have "∃z. Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ ¬Has y z" sledgehammer
  (* Combine the known information with the inferred absence of expression to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
