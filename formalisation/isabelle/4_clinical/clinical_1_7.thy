(* Explanation 1: Olaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licensed for use in prostate cancer patients and is a potential treatment option for any patient with loss of BRCA2 due to its mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Olaparib x ∧ PARP1Inhibitor x ∧ LicensedForUseIn x y ∧ ProstateCancerPatient y ∧ PotentialTreatmentOption x ∧ Patient z ∧ LossOfBRCA2 z ∧ DueTo x MechanismOfAction"

(* Explanation 2: Rucaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licensed for use in prostate cancer patients and is a potential treatment option for any patient with loss of BRCA2 due to its mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Rucaparib x ∧ PARP1Inhibitor x ∧ LicensedForUseIn x y ∧ ProstateCancerPatient y ∧ PotentialTreatmentOption x ∧ Patient z ∧ LossOfBRCA2 z ∧ DueTo x MechanismOfAction"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality, which causes cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA, making Olaparib and Rucaparib viable treatment options. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3 e4 e5. Patient x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1Inhibition y ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Benefit e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Source e1 y ∧ DueTo z y ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Agent e2 Cell ∧ Rely e3 ∧ Agent e3 Cell ∧ Agent e3 SingularMechanism ∧ Repair e4 ∧ Agent e4 SingularMechanism ∧ Agent e4 CumulativeDamageToDNA ∧ Make e5 ∧ Agent e5 x ∧ Agent e5 y ∧ ViableTreatmentOption x ∧ ViableTreatmentOption y"

(* Explanation 4: The patient in question has a loss of BRCA2, which makes both Olaparib and Rucaparib viable and distinct treatment options for them due to their mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 y ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ ViableTreatmentOption x ∧ ViableTreatmentOption z ∧ DistinctTreatmentOption x ∧ DistinctTreatmentOption z ∧ For x y ∧ For z y ∧ DueTo y MechanismOfAction"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient z"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ Patient z ∧ For x z ∧ For y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that z is a patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient z" by simp
  (* Explanation 4 states that the patient in question has a loss of BRCA2, which makes both Olaparib and Rucaparib viable and distinct treatment options for them due to their mechanism of action. *)
  (* This implies that both Olaparib and Rucaparib are viable treatment options for the patient. *)
  from explanation_4 have "ViableTreatmentOption Olaparib ∧ ViableTreatmentOption Rucaparib ∧ DistinctTreatmentOption Olaparib ∧ DistinctTreatmentOption Rucaparib ∧ For Olaparib z ∧ For Rucaparib z" sledgehammer
  (* Since Olaparib and Rucaparib are viable treatment options, they are also treatment options. *)
  then have "TreatmentOption Olaparib ∧ TreatmentOption Rucaparib" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, there exist two treatment options for the patient z. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
