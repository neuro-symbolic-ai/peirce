(* Explanation 1: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ EffectiveInTreating x y ∧ With y z"

(* Explanation 2: Dasatinib has been shown to up-regulate phosphorylation of YAP, causing increased sequestration into the cytoplasm and decreased binding. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. Dasatinib x ∧ YAP y ∧ Cytoplasm z ∧ Shown e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ UpRegulate e2 ∧ Phosphorylation e2 y ∧ Cause e2 e3 ∧ Sequestration e3 ∧ Into e3 z ∧ DecreasedBinding e3"

(* Explanation 3: The mechanism by which Dasatinib affects YAP is similar to that of YAP inhibitors, making it potentially effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Dasatinib x ∧ YAP y ∧ YAPInhibitor z ∧ Patient w ∧ CTNNB1Mutation e1 ∧ Activating e1 ∧ Affect e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Similar e2 z ∧ EffectiveInTreating x w ∧ With w e1"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Dasatinib x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: Dasatinib may be effective in treating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. Dasatinib x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y ∧ EffectiveInTreating x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Dasatinib and CTNNB1Mutation. *)
  from asm have "Dasatinib x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical equivalence between the effectiveness of Dasatinib and YAP inhibitors in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(E, A), which implies both Implies(E, A) and Implies(A, E). *)
  (* From explanation_3, we know that Dasatinib is effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "EffectiveInTreating x y" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that Dasatinib may be effective in treating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
