(* Explanation 1: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ⟶ RelevantFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: NCT03568656 is available for patients who have advanced solid tumours *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour z ∧ Have y z ⟶ AvailableFor x y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient has soft tissue sarcoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma y ∧ Have x y"

(* Explanation 4: Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of advanced solid tumour *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. SoftTissueSarcoma x ⟶ AdvancedSolidTumour x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may be eligible for NCT03568656 *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y ⟶ EligibleFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and NCT03568656. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 and Explanation 4 provide a logical relation Implies(C, D), 
     which implies that if a patient has soft tissue sarcoma, it is a type of advanced solid tumour. *)
  from explanation_3 obtain z where "Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma z ∧ Have x z" sledgehammer
  (* Using Explanation 4, we can infer that soft tissue sarcoma is a type of advanced solid tumour. *)
  from `SoftTissueSarcoma z` have "AdvancedSolidTumour z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 2 states that NCT03568656 is available for patients who have advanced solid tumours. *)
  (* Since we have established that the patient has an advanced solid tumour, we can use Explanation 2. *)
  from `NCT03568656 y ∧ Patient x ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour z ∧ Have x z` have "AvailableFor y x" <ATP>
  (* If NCT03568656 is available for the patient, then the patient may be eligible for NCT03568656. *)
  then have "EligibleFor x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
