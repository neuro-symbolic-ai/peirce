(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that specifically target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, which involves polyADP-ribosylation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ AnticancerAgents x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Role w ∧ Recovery w ∧ FromDamage w ∧ Involves w z ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage, and this process is disrupted by [PARP1/2] inhibitors to target tumor-specific defects. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ In x z ∧ Process z ∧ Crucial z ∧ Recovery z ∧ FromDamage z ∧ Disrupted e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ By e2 x ∧ Target e2 ∧ Defects y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ ThroughRole e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about inhibitors, defects, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies([PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents, target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair) *)
  (* Since we have Inhibitors x, we can infer that they target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  then have "Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 1 also provides that this targeting involves interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This interference is through the role of PARP1/2, which involves polyADP-ribosylation. *)
  then have "ThroughRole e1 z" <ATP>
  (* Combining these, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
