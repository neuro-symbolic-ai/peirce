(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. InhibitingBetaCatenin x ∧ Patients y ∧ ActivatingCTTNB1Mutations y ⟶ EffectiveInTreating x y"

(* Explanation 2: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway have shown activity in reducing β-catenin levels. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Drugs x ∧ TargetingWntPathway x ∧ Activity y ∧ ReducingBetaCateninLevels e ∧ Show e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: Reducing β-catenin levels is equivalent to inhibiting β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e1 e2. ReducingBetaCateninLevels e1 ⟷ InhibitingBetaCatenin e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Drugs x ∧ TargetingWntPathway x ∧ Patients y ∧ ActivatingCTTNB1Mutations y"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ TargetingWntPathway x ∧ Patients y ∧ ActivatingCTTNB1Mutations y ⟶ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about drugs, targeting the Wnt pathway, patients, and activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from asm have "Drugs x ∧ TargetingWntPathway x ∧ Patients y ∧ ActivatingCTTNB1Mutations y" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, E), Implies(drugs targeting the Wnt pathway, inhibiting β-catenin) *)
  (* C is from explanatory sentence 2, E is from explanatory sentence 3. *)
  (* We already have Drugs x and TargetingWntPathway x, so we can infer InhibitingBetaCatenin x. *)
  then have "InhibitingBetaCatenin x" using explanation_2 explanation_3 by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(inhibiting β-catenin, treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have InhibitingBetaCatenin x and Patients y and ActivatingCTTNB1Mutations y, so we can infer EffectiveInTreating x y. *)
  then have "EffectiveInTreating x y" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
