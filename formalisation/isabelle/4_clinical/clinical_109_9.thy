(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ HER2PositiveBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ⟶ HER2Amplification y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which directly implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer, and this is associated with the patient having a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ (V777LHER2Mutated z ∧ HER2Amplified z ⟶ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y) ∧ AssociatedWith y z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation directly leads to a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and this specific type of breast cancer inherently includes both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. V777LHER2Mutation x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ LeadsTo x y ∧ CharacterizedBy y x ∧ Includes y x"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2Amplification x ∧ BreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

(* Explanation 5: A patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and this specific type of breast cancer inherently includes both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and is associated with the patient having breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ Includes z y ∧ AssociatedWith z x ∧ Has x z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y" by simp
  (* Explanation 5 provides a direct link between a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation and a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, E) to infer the specific type of breast cancer. *)
  from explanation_5 obtain z where "Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ CharacterizedBy y z ∧ Includes y z ∧ AssociatedWith y x ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
  (* From the logical relation Implies(E, D) and Implies(E, B), we can infer V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification. *)
  then have "V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
