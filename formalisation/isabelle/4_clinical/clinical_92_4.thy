(* Explanation 1: PARP2 encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 2 protein, which contains a catalytic domain capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. PARP2 x ∧ Protein y ∧ CatalyticDomain z ∧ Encodes x y ∧ Contains y z ∧ Catalyzing z"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferase which, via polyADP-ribosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ Transferase y ∧ NuclearProtein z ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation e ∧ Is x y ∧ Modifies e z ∧ InvolvedIn z e ∧ Important e ∧ CellularProcess e ∧ RecoveryFromDNA_Damage e"

(* Explanation 3: PolyADP-ribosylation, involving both PARP1 and PARP2, is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage and is important for these recovery processes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. PolyADP_Ribosylation x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ NuclearProtein e1 ∧ RecoveryProcess e2 ∧ InvolvedIn y x ∧ InvolvedIn z x ∧ CrucialFor x e1 ∧ Modifying e1 ∧ PlayRole e1 e2 ∧ ImportantFor x e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z ∧ Process z ∧ RecoveryFromDNA_Damage z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about PARP1 and PARP2. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y" by auto
  (* Explanation 3 provides information about PolyADP-ribosylation involving both PARP1 and PARP2. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, F), Implies(PolyADP-ribosylation involves both PARP1 and PARP2, crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage) *)
  (* Explanation 3 also states that PolyADP-ribosylation is important for recovery processes. *)
  from explanation_3 obtain z where "PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z ∧ RecoveryProcess z" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that z is a process and involves recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "Process z ∧ RecoveryFromDNA_Damage z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
