(* Explanation 1: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y ⟶ ConsideredFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: The patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, and this inappropriateness extends to immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ⟶ (¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ExtendsTo (¬AppropriateFor x y) z)"

(* Explanation 3: No PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient with TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that the patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, and this inappropriateness extends to immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Not(B), Not(patient is appropriate for immunotherapy) *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that no PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Not(D), Not(PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient) *)
  (* We need to show that the patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy. *)
  (* Using the derived implications, we can infer that if the patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, then they are not appropriate for PARP inhibitors, and vice versa. *)
