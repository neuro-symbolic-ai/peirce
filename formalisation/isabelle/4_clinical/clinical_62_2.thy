(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene y ∧ BRCA2Protein z ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ⟶ (x = y)"

(* Explanation 2: The BRCA2 protein is a human protein and is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR)"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ (x = y)"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have BRCA2 x and HumanProtein y. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 states that BRCA2Protein implies HumanProtein and InvolvedIn HRR. *)
  (* Since we have HumanProtein y, we can infer that y is involved in HRR if y is a BRCA2Protein. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ (HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x HRR)" by meson
  (* We need to show that if BRCA2 x and HumanProtein y and InvolvedIn y HRR, then x = y. *)
  (* Using explanation 1, we know that BRCA2 x implies that x is a human gene encoding a BRCA2 protein. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∀x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene y ∧ BRCA2Protein z ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ⟶ (x = y)" by meson
  (* Since y is a HumanProtein and InvolvedIn HRR, and BRCA2 x, we can conclude x = y. *)
