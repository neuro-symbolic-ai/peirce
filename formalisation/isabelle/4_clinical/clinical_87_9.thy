(* Explanation 1: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ CheckpointInhibitorAnticancerDrugs x"

(* Explanation 2: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs have started to make progress in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with promising outcomes both in the early and the metastatic setting. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e1 e2. (PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ Progress y ∧ Started e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y TNBC ∧ Outcomes e2 ∧ Promising e2 ∧ In e2 EarlySetting ∧ In e2 MetastaticSetting"

(* Explanation 3: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x"

(* Explanation 4: As immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. (PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y TNBC"

(* Explanation 5: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, have shown promising outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by effectively targeting and modulating the immune response, indicating the existence of events where these outcomes occur. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Shown e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y TNBC ∧ Targeting e2 ∧ Modulating e3 ∧ ImmuneResponse z ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ Indicating e1 e2"

(* Explanation 6: The existence of events where immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, have shown promising outcomes in TNBC implies that these inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e1 e2. (ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Shown e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y TNBC) ⟶ (Had e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ In y TNBC)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ In y TNBC"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  shows "∃x y e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y TNBC"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about immune checkpoint inhibitors, outcomes, and their promising nature in TNBC. *)
  from asm have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ In y TNBC" by blast
  (* Explanation 6 provides a logical relation that the existence of events where immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising outcomes in TNBC implies that these inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of such an event. *)
  then have "Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y TNBC" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
