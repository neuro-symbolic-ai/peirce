(* Explanation 1: Patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation x ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x"

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ BRAF_V600E_Kinase z ∧ ATP_Binding_Site z ∧ Bind e1 ∧ Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Agent e2 z"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation x ∧ Candidate z ∧ For z y ∧ Treatment y ∧ With y w ∧ Vemurafenib w"

(* Explanation 4: Being a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib directly implies having the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. Candidate x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ⟶ PotentialToReceive x z"

(* Explanation 5: This potential is directly linked to their mutation status. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Potential x ∧ MutationStatus y ⟶ Linked x y"

(* Explanation 6: Candidates for treatment with vemurafenib, due to their BRAF V600E mutation, are likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∃x y z e w. Candidate x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation x ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e z ∧ AsOption z w ∧ Treatment w"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ For y V600E"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y V600E"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Patient x and Vemurafenib z. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ For y V600E" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 and logical relation Implies(A, C) imply that a patient with a BRAF V600E mutation is a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation x" by blast
  then have "Candidate x" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 4 and logical relation Implies(C, D) imply that being a candidate implies having the potential to receive vemurafenib. *)
  then have "PotentialToReceive x z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 6 and logical relation Implies(C, F) imply that candidates are likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
  then have "Receive e" <ATP>
  (* We can now construct the hypothesis statement. *)
  then show "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y V600E" <ATP>
