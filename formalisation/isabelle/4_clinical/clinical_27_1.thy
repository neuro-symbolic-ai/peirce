(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, then drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective for that patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y ⟶ (Drugs z ∧ TargetingWntPathway z ∧ EffectiveFor z x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ TargetingWntPathway x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know there exists a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x y where "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y" by blast
  (* Using Explanation 2, we can infer that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective for that patient. *)
  then have "Drugs z ∧ TargetingWntPathway z ∧ EffectiveFor z x" using explanation_2 by blast
  (* We need to show that there exist such drugs that are effective in this patient. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
