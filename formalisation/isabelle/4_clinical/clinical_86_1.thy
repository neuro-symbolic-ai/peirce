(* Explanation 1: Patient PD-L1 status unknown *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PatientPDL1Status x ⟶ Unknown x"

(* Explanation 2: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC, particularly in patients with known PD-L1 status *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Promising y ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ In y z ∧ KnownPDL1Status y"

(* Explanation 3: The appropriateness of immune checkpoint inhibitors for a patient is often determined by the patient's PD-L1 status *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ PDL1Status z ∧ Appropriateness x y ∧ Determined e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Often e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y"
  (* Hypothesis: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
  shows "∀x y. Patient x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y ⟶ AppropriateFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 states that if the Patient PD-L1 status is unknown, it implies Unknown. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that the appropriateness of immune checkpoint inhibitors is determined by the patient's PD-L1 status. *)
  (* Since the PD-L1 status is unknown, we cannot determine the appropriateness. *)
  (* Therefore, it is unknown whether the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "Unknown (AppropriateFor x y)" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
