(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ AnticancerAgent x ∧ TumorSpecificDefect y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ In x z ∧ Important e2 ∧ Process e2 ∧ Include e2 z ∧ Recovery e2 ∧ From e2 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitor x ∧ TumourSpecificDefect y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ TumourSpecificDefect y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Role e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Recover e2 ∧ From e2 y"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Inhibitor x, TumourSpecificDefect y, and DNARepair z. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitor x ∧ TumourSpecificDefect y ∧ DNARepair z" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 1 provides that [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* This implies that there exists an event e1 where Inhibitor x is the agent, TumourSpecificDefect y is the patient, and y is in z. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃e1. Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z" sledgehammer
  
  (* Explanation 2 provides that PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in polyADP-ribosylation, which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies the existence of an event e2 where the role of PARP1/2 is involved in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃e2. Role e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Recover e2 ∧ From e2 y" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the results from explanation_1 and explanation_2, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
