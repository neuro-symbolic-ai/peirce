(* Explanation 1: Patient PD-L1 status unknown. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PatientPDL1Status x ⟶ Unknown x"

(* Explanation 2: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient e x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y"
  (* Hypothesis: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  shows "∀x y. (∃e. Patient e x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y) ⟶ AppropriateFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  from asm have "Patient e x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 states that if a patient's PD-L1 status is known, it is unknown. *)
  (* However, this does not directly relate to the appropriateness for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides information about the outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC, but does not directly relate to the appropriateness for a specific patient. *)
  (* Since there is no direct logical relation or derived implication connecting the premise to the hypothesis, we cannot infer the hypothesis directly from the given explanations. *)
  (* Therefore, the hypothesis remains unknown based on the provided information. *)
