(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ HER2_Positive_BreastCancer y ∧ HER2_Amplification z ∧ With x y ⟶ Implies y z"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer, and this is associated with the patient having breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated_Status z ∧ HER2_Amplification w ∧ BreastCancer w ∧ Has x y ∧ (Implies y z ∧ Implies y w) ∧ AssociatedWith y x ∧ BreastCancer x"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation is associated with breast cancer and implies HER2 amplification in such cases. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. V777L_HER2_Mutation x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HER2_Amplification z ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ Implies x z"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2_Amplification x ∧ CertainTypes_BreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated y ∧ HER2_Amplified z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ Has x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  
  (* Explanation 2 provides that a patient with a known V777L HER2 mutation implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification, and is associated with breast cancer. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain y z w where 
    "Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated_Status z ∧ HER2_Amplification w ∧ BreastCancer w ∧ Has x y ∧ (Implies y z ∧ Implies y w) ∧ AssociatedWith y x ∧ BreastCancer x" sledgehammer
  
  (* From the logical relation Implies(C, D), we know that a known V777L HER2 mutation implies V777L HER2 mutated status. *)
  then have "V777L_HER2_Mutated_Status y" <ATP>
  
  (* From the logical relation Implies(C, B), we know that a known V777L HER2 mutation implies HER2 amplification. *)
  then have "HER2_Amplification w" <ATP>
  
  (* From the logical relation Implies(C, E), we know that a known V777L HER2 mutation implies the patient has breast cancer. *)
  then have "BreastCancer y" <ATP>
  
  (* We need to show that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* We already have V777L_HER2_Mutated_Status y and HER2_Amplification w, and BreastCancer y. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
