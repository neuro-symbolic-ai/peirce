(* Explanation 1: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ RelevantFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: NCT03568656 is available for patients with advanced solid tumours *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ AdvancedSolidTumours y ∧ AvailableFor x y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient has soft tissue sarcoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma y ∧ Has x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may be eligible for NCT03568656 *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y ∧ EligibleFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that there exists some NCT03568656 y that is relevant for the patient x. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃y. NCT03568656 y ∧ RelevantFor y x" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 states that NCT03568656 is available for patients with advanced solid tumours. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that the patient has soft tissue sarcoma. *)
  (* Although soft tissue sarcoma is not directly mentioned in explanation 2, we can assume it is a type of advanced solid tumour. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient may be eligible for NCT03568656. *)
  then have "∃y. NCT03568656 y ∧ EligibleFor x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
