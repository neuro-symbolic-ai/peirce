(* Explanation 1: Olaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licensed for use in prostate cancer patients and is a potential treatment option for any patient with loss of BRCA2 due to its mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z w v. Olaparib x ∧ PARP1Inhibitor y ∧ LicensedForUse y z ∧ ProstateCancerPatient z ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ Patient w ∧ LossOfBRCA2 w ∧ MechanismOfAction v ⟶ (For x w ∧ (∃e. DueTo e v))"

(* Explanation 2: Rucaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licensed for use in prostate cancer patients and is a potential treatment option for any patient with loss of BRCA2 due to its mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z w v. Rucaparib x ∧ PARP1Inhibitor y ∧ LicensedForUse y z ∧ ProstateCancerPatient z ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ Patient w ∧ LossOfBRCA2 w ∧ MechanismOfAction v ⟶ (For x w ∧ (∃e. DueTo e v))"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality, which causes cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA, making Olaparib and Rucaparib viable treatment options. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 w u v. Patient x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1Inhibition y ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Benefit e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Source e1 y ∧ DueTo e1 z ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Cell w ∧ Rely e3 ∧ Agent e3 w ∧ Mechanism v ∧ On e3 v ∧ Repair e4 ∧ Agent e4 w ∧ Damage u ∧ DNA u ∧ Cumulative u ∧ Making e5 ∧ Agent e5 w ∧ Patient x ∧ Viable e5"

(* Explanation 4: The patient in question has a loss of BRCA2, which makes both Olaparib and Rucaparib viable treatment options for them due to their mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 y ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient x ∧ Viable e2 ∧ For x y ∧ MechanismOfAction z ∧ DueTo e2 z"

(* Explanation 5: Olaparib and Rucaparib are distinct treatment options because they are different drugs with unique properties, even though they share a similar mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e. Olaparib x ∧ Rucaparib y ∧ Distinct z ∧ TreatmentOption z ∧ Because z (DifferentDrug x ∧ UniqueProperty x ∧ DifferentDrug y ∧ UniqueProperty y) ∧ Share e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ MechanismOfAction z ∧ Similar z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient z"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ Patient z ∧ For x z ∧ For y z"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Patient z. *)
  from asm have "Patient z" by simp
  (* Explanation 4 states that the patient in question has a loss of BRCA2, making both Olaparib and Rucaparib viable treatment options. *)
  (* This implies that Olaparib and Rucaparib are viable treatment options for the patient in question. *)
  have "∃x y. TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ For x z ∧ For y z" 
  proof -
    (* Explanation 1 and 2 imply that Olaparib and Rucaparib are potential treatment options for any patient with loss of BRCA2. *)
    (* Explanation 5 states that Olaparib and Rucaparib are distinct treatment options. *)
    (* Therefore, we can conclude that there are two distinct treatment options for the patient. *)
    have "Olaparib x ∧ Rucaparib y ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ TreatmentOption y ∧ For x z ∧ For y z" sledgehammer
    then show ?thesis <ATP>
