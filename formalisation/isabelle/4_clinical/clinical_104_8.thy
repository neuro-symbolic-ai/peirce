(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain should overcome trastuzumab resistance that has been induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Targeted x y ∧ HER2_Kinase_Domain y ∧ Trastuzumab_Resistance z ∧ HER2_Activating_Mutation z ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 2: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. HER2_V777L x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Resistance y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor can directly overcome the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, and this action is a necessary step in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Resistance z ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Directly overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation implies overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e1 e2. Resistance x ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Treatment_Resistance y ⟶ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y"

(* Explanation 5: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor is specifically aimed at overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, which is a critical factor in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Resistance z ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about HER_V777L_Mutation and Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x" by auto
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation Implies(F, G), which states that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor directly overcomes the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides a logical relation Implies(G, H), which states that directly overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation implies overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  (* Combining these, we have the derived implication Implies(F, H), which states that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor implies overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  (* Since we have Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x and HER_V777L_Mutation y, we can infer targeting and overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  then have "Targeting x ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
