(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, specifically through disrupting polyADP-ribosylation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ AnticancerAgent x ∧ Defect y ∧ Repair z ∧ PolyADPRibosylation w ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Role e2 w ∧ Through e2 w"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (PARP1 x ∨ PARP2 x) ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ⟶ InvolvedIn x y"

(* Explanation 3: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly interferes with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Defect z ∧ Repair z ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Role e2 y ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage is a mechanism by which [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ Role e1 y ∧ Defect z ∧ Repair z ∧ Interfere e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Role e1 y ∧ Target e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 5: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors is a direct mechanism that leads to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Defect z ∧ Repair z ∧ Role e1 w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Through e2 w"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ Repair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ Repair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the inhibitor, defect, and repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ Repair z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a scenario where [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Explanation 5 states that disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors is a direct mechanism that leads to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Using explanation_5, we can infer the existence of such a targeting event. *)
  from explanation_5 obtain e1 e2 where "Inhibitor x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Defect z ∧ Repair z ∧ Role e1 w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Through e2 w" sledgehammer
  (* We can conclude that there exists an event e such that the inhibitor targets the defect through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "∃e. Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Through e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
