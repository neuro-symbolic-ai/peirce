(* Explanation 1: Patient with activating PIK3CA A3140G mutated metastatic Breast Cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Breast y ∧ Metastatic y ∧ Mutated y ∧ Activating y ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ A3140G y ∧ With x y"

(* Explanation 2: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PIK3Ca x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Known x ∧ Frequent x ∧ Activating x ∧ Cancer y ∧ Breast y ⟶ In x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Cancer z ∧ Breast z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Seen e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Frequent e2 ∧ Cancer z ∧ Breast z ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, mutation, activating mutation, PIK3Ca, cancer, and breast. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ Cancer z ∧ Breast z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation that PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that the mutation y is in the cancer z. *)
  then have "In y z" <ATP>
  (* We need to show that the patient has an activating PIK3Ca mutation which is seen frequently in breast cancer. *)
  (* We can construct events e1 and e2 to represent the 'has' and 'seen' relations. *)
  let ?e1 = "undefined" (* Placeholder for event e1 *)
  let ?e2 = "undefined" (* Placeholder for event e2 *)
  have "Has ?e1 ∧ Agent ?e1 x ∧ Patient ?e1 y" <ATP>
  have "Seen ?e2 ∧ Agent ?e2 y ∧ Frequent ?e2" <ATP>
  (* Combine all the information to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
