(* Explanation 1: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib z ⟶ (Candidate x z ∧ With x y)"

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Kinase y ∧ ATP_Binding_Site z ∧ Bind e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PatientEvent e1 z ∧ Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ PatientEvent e2 y ∧ Selectively e1 ∧ Selectively e2"

(* Explanation 3: Being a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib directly implies having the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. Candidate x y ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ⟶ PotentialToReceive x z"

(* Explanation 4: The potential to receive vemurafenib is directly linked to the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. PotentialToReceive x y ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ⟶ LinkedTo x z"

(* Explanation 5: Candidates for treatment with vemurafenib, due to their BRAF V600E mutation, are likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. Candidate x y ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation x ⟶ LikelyToReceive x z"

(* Explanation 6: If a patient is likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option, then they could actually receive vemurafenib for their BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation z ∧ LikelyToReceive x y ⟶ (∃e. Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ For y z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, treatment, and vemurafenib. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 states that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that being a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib directly implies having the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
  (* Explanation 5 states that candidates for treatment with vemurafenib, due to their BRAF V600E mutation, are likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
  (* Explanation 6 states that if a patient is likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option, then they could actually receive vemurafenib for their BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* Using the logical relations and derived implications, we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  have "Candidate x z" sledgehammer
  then have "PotentialToReceive x z" <ATP>
  then have "LikelyToReceive x z" <ATP>
  then have "∃e. Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e z ∧ For z y" <ATP>
