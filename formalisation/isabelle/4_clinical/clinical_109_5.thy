(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ HER2PositiveBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ⟶ HER2Amplification y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer, and this is associated with the patient having breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ (V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplification y ⟶ BreastCancer z) ∧ AssociatedWith y z"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation is associated with breast cancer and implies HER2 amplification in such cases. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. V777LHER2Mutation x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ (BreastCancer y ⟶ HER2Amplification y)"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2Amplification x ∧ BreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

(* Explanation 5: A patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ HER2Amplification z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 2 provides that a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, D) and Implies(C, B) to infer V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain z where "V777LHER2Mutation z ∧ Has x z" sledgehammer
  then have "V777LHER2Mutated z ∧ HER2Amplification z" <ATP>
  
  (* Explanation 5 states that a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, H) to infer the specific type of breast cancer. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplification y ∧ Has x y" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
