(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ AnticancerAgents y ∧ Defects z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ ClassOf x y ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In z w ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Role e2 w"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ In x z ∧ Important z ∧ Processes z ∧ Recovery z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ ThroughRole e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about inhibitors, defects, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation: Implies(A, And(B, C)), which means [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents implies they target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair and interfere with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Since we have Inhibitors x, we can infer the existence of an event e1 where Target e1, Agent e1 x, Patient e1 y, and In y z. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃e1. Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 provides that PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in polyADP-ribosylation, which is important in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* We can use the derived implication: Implies(C, F), which means interfere with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage implies polyADP-ribosylation is important in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of an event e2 where ThroughRole e2 z. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃e2. ThroughRole e2 z" <ATP>
  (* Combining these, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
