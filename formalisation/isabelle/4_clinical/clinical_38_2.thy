(* Explanation 1: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257 is a TTK inhibitor in phase 1 studies in patients with Breast cancer and advanced solid tumours. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. CFI402257 x ∧ TTKInhibitor x ∧ Phase1Studies y ∧ Patient z ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ AdvancedSolidTumours z ∧ In x y ∧ In x z"

(* Explanation 3: If CFI-402257, as a TTK Inhibitor, is effective in a patient, then it may be suitable for that patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. (CFI402257 x ∧ TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y) ⟶ SuitableFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
  shows "∃x y. CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about CFI-402257 and the patient. *)
  from asm have "CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that a TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  (* Explanation 2 confirms that CFI-402257 is a TTK inhibitor. *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation: If CFI-402257, as a TTK Inhibitor, is effective in a patient, then it may be suitable for that patient. *)
  (* We need to show that CFI-402257 is effective in the patient to use the logical relation from Explanation 3. *)
  (* Explanation 1 implies that there exists a TTK Inhibitor effective in a patient, which can be CFI-402257. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain a b where "TTKInhibitor a ∧ Patient b ∧ EffectiveIn a b" by blast
  (* Since CFI-402257 is a TTK Inhibitor, we can substitute a with x and b with y. *)
  then have "EffectiveIn x y" sledgehammer
  (* Now, using Explanation 3, we can infer that CFI-402257 may be suitable for the patient. *)
  then have "SuitableFor x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
