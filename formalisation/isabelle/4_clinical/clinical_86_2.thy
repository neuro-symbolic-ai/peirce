(* Explanation 1: Patient PD-L1 status unknown *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x. PatientPDL1Status x ∧ Unknown x"

(* Explanation 2: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC, particularly in patients with known PD-L1 status *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ PromisingOutcomes y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had y ∧ PatientPDL1StatusKnown w ∧ In y z ∧ ParticularlyIn y w"

(* Explanation 3: The appropriateness of immune checkpoint inhibitors for a patient is often determined by the patient's PD-L1 status *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ AppropriatenessFor x y ∧ PatientPDL1Status z ∧ DeterminedBy z x y ∧ Often z"

(* Explanation 4: If a patient's PD-L1 status is unknown, it is unknown whether the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. (PatientPDL1Status x ∧ Unknown x) ⟶ (Patient y ∧ Unknown y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
  shows "∃x. Patient x ∧ AppropriateFor x y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know there exists a patient with unknown PD-L1 status. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain a where "PatientPDL1Status a ∧ Unknown a" by blast
  (* Explanation 4 states that if a patient's PD-L1 status is unknown, it is unknown whether the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Unknown x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y" using explanation_4 by blast
  (* We need to show that there exists a patient x such that it is unknown whether they are appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
