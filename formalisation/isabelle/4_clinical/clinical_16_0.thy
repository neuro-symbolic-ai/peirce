(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair y"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z w. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ DoubleStrandBreakRepairProcess x ∧ DamagedDNA y ∧ Replaced z ∧ Patient z y ∧ Agent z w ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules w ∧ (From w SisterChromatids ∨ From w PaternalMaternalChromosomes)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in double strand break DNA break repair via homologous recombination repair. *)
  shows "∀x y z. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ InvolvedIn x y ∧ DoubleStrandBreakRepair y ∧ Via y z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about BRCA2 and HumanProtein. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 provides that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* This is related to logical proposition A and B. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, involved in homologous recombination repair). *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Explanation 2 provides that homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process. *)
  (* This is related to logical proposition C and D. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes). *)
  then have "DoubleStrandBreakRepair y ∧ Via y z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z" sledgehammer
  (* Combining the above, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
