(* Explanation 1: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. (Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Treatment z ∧ With x y) ⟶ (CandidateFor x z ∧ With z x)"  (* Corrected With usage *)

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Kinase y ∧ ATP_Binding_Site z ∧ Bind e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PatientEvent e1 z ∧ Selectively e1 ∧ Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ PatientEvent e2 y"

(* Explanation 3: Being a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib directly implies having the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. (CandidateFor x y ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z) ⟶ DirectlyImplies x z"  (* Corrected DirectlyImplies usage *)

(* Explanation 4: The potential to receive vemurafenib is directly linked to the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. (PotentialToReceive x y ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y) ⟶ DirectlyLinkedTo x y"  (* Corrected PotentialToReceive usage *)

(* Explanation 5: Candidates for treatment with vemurafenib, due to their BRAF V600E mutation, are likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. (CandidateFor x y ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation x) ⟶ LikelyToReceive x z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y z"  (* Corrected For usage *)
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, treatment, and vemurafenib. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 and logical relation Implies(A, B) suggest that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* Explanation 3 and logical relation Implies(B, E) suggest that being a candidate for treatment with vemurafenib implies having the potential to receive it. *)
  (* Explanation 5 and logical relation Implies(B, G) suggest that candidates for treatment with vemurafenib are likely to receive it. *)
  (* We can infer that the patient is likely to receive treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  then have "LikelyToReceive x z" sledgehammer
  (* From the derived implication Implies(A, G), we know that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are likely to receive vemurafenib. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  then have "Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
