(* Explanation 1: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y ⟶ ConsideredFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: The patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, and it is unknown whether the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors z ⟶ (¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ Unknown (AppropriateFor x z))"

(* Explanation 3: No PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor y x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient with TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that the patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that no PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient. *)
  (* We need to show that for any y and z, if y is Immunotherapy or z is PARPInhibitors, then the patient is not appropriate for y and z. *)
  {
    fix y z
    assume "Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z"
    then have "¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
    proof
      assume "Immunotherapy y"
      (* From explanation 2, we have ¬AppropriateFor x y for Immunotherapy y. *)
      then have "¬AppropriateFor x y" sledgehammer
      (* From derived implications, Implies(Not(B), Not(D)), we have ¬AppropriateFor x z for PARPInhibitors z. *)
      then have "¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
      thus "¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
    next
      assume "PARPInhibitors z"
      (* From explanation 3, we have ¬AppropriateFor x z for PARPInhibitors z. *)
      then have "¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
      (* From derived implications, Implies(Not(D), Not(B)), we have ¬AppropriateFor x y for Immunotherapy y. *)
      then have "¬AppropriateFor x y" <ATP>
      thus "¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
