(* Explanation 1: Patient has hepatoblastoma with a mutation CTNNB1 W25_H36del. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Mutation z ∧ Has x y ∧ With y z"

(* Explanation 2: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CTNNB1_W25_H36del x ⟶ (Mutation x ∧ Activating x)"

(* Explanation 3: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is within the CTNNB1 gene. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. CTNNB1_W25_H36del x ⟶ Within x CTNNB1_gene"

(* Explanation 4: If a patient has a mutation that is an activating mutation and is within the CTNNB1 gene, then the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ Activating y ∧ Within y CTNNB1_gene) ⟶ (Has x y ∧ In y CTNNB)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Within y CTNNB1_gene"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Has x y ∧ In y CTNNB1"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, mutation, activating mutation, and its location within the CTNNB1 gene. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ Within y CTNNB1_gene" by simp
  (* Explanation 4 provides a logical relation: If a patient has a mutation that is an activating mutation and is within the CTNNB1 gene, then the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  (* We can use this relation to infer that the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  then have "Has x y ∧ In y CTNNB" sledgehammer
  (* We now have all the components needed to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
