(* Explanation 1: Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. NotchInhibitor x ∧ BetaCatenin y ∧ Decrease e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. CTNNB1Mutation x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cell z ∧ BetaCatenin z ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via y z"

(* Explanation 3: There are Notch inhibitors in development. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x. NotchInhibitor x ∧ InDevelopment x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Effective x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. (NotchInhibitor x ∧ Effective x ∧ (∃e. Patient e y) ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y) ⟶ Treat x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have a Notch inhibitor that is effective and a patient with a CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  from asm have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Effective x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 states that Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
  (* By decreasing β-catenin, the Notch inhibitor can potentially counteract the proliferation promoted by CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* Therefore, the Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating the patient with the CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  then have "Treat x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
