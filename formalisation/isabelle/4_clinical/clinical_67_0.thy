(* Explanation 1: Fully active PKB/Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including angiogenesis, metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, transcription, and apoptosis. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. PKB_Akt x ∧ FullyActive x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y Angiogenesis ∧ Including y Metabolism ∧ Including y Growth ∧ Including y Proliferation ∧ Including y Survival ∧ Including y ProteinSynthesis ∧ Including y Transcription ∧ Including y Apoptosis"

(* Explanation 2: Phosphorylation of bound Akt stimulates full activity of Akt. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Phosphorylation x ∧ BoundAkt y ∧ Stimulates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ FullActivity y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x"
  (* Hypothesis: Fully activated Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y Proliferation ∧ Including y Survival"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Akt being fully activated. *)
  from asm have "Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation Implies(A, B), where A is PKB/Akt is fully active and B is mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  (* Since Akt x is fully activated, it can be considered as fully active PKB/Akt. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that it mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  then have "∃y e. CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y Proliferation ∧ Including y Survival" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
