(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HER2_Positive y ∧ With x y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ Has x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated y ∧ HER2_Amplified y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides information about HER2+ breast cancer. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides information about a known V777L HER2 mutation. *)
  (* We need to show that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* Since the explanations provide the necessary conditions, we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated y ∧ HER2_Amplified y ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
