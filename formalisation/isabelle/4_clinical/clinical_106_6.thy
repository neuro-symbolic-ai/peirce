(* Explanation 1: HER2 V777L is coincident with HER2-amplification in breast cancers that have developed resistance to Trastuzumab *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. HER2V777L x ∧ HER2Amplification y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Coincident x y ∧ Resistance z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Developed e ∧ Agent e z"

(* Explanation 2: HER2 V777L can directly cause mechanisms that lead to resistance to antibody therapies, including Trastuzumab, by being a primary factor in such mechanisms *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2V777L x ∧ Mechanism y ∧ Resistance z ∧ AntibodyTherapy z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ PrimaryFactor x y"

(* Explanation 3: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy due to direct mechanisms involving HER2 V777L *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. PatientEntity x ∧ Resistance y ∧ TrastuzumabTherapy y ∧ Mechanism z ∧ HER2V777L z ∧ Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Involving z y"

(* Explanation 4: Resistance to antibody therapies, including Trastuzumab, can occur due to mechanisms involving HER2 V777L *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. Resistance x ∧ AntibodyTherapy x ∧ Trastuzumab x ∧ Mechanism y ∧ HER2V777L y ∧ Occur e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Involving y x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy y"
  (* Hypothesis: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to antibody therapy *)
  shows "∃x y e. HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about HER2V777L, Resistance, and AntibodyTherapy. *)
  from asm have "HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy y" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation that HER2 V777L can directly cause mechanisms leading to resistance to antibody therapies. *)
  (* This implies that there exists a causal event involving HER2V777L and Resistance to AntibodyTherapy. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of a causal event. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃e. Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  (* Combining the known information and the inferred causal event, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
