(* Explanation 1: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patients y ∧ ActivatingCTTNB1Mutations z ∧ EffectiveInTreating x y ∧ With y z"

(* Explanation 2: Dasatinib has been shown to up-regulate phosphorylation of YAP causing increased sequestration into the cytoplasm and decrease binding. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. Dasatinib x ∧ Phosphorylation y ∧ YAP z ∧ UpRegulate e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Of y z ∧ Cause e1 e2 ∧ Sequestration e2 ∧ IntoCytoplasm e2 ∧ Cause e1 e3 ∧ DecreaseBinding e3"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Dasatinib x ∧ CTNNB1Mutations y"
  (* Hypothesis: Dasatinib may be effective in treating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. Dasatinib x ∧ CTNNB1Mutations y ∧ EffectiveInTreating x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Dasatinib and CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from asm have "Dasatinib x ∧ CTNNB1Mutations y" by auto
  (* Explanation 2 provides information about Dasatinib's effect on YAP. *)
  (* We know that Dasatinib up-regulates phosphorylation of YAP, which causes increased sequestration into the cytoplasm and decreased binding. *)
  (* These effects are related to the mechanism of action of YAP inhibitors. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that a YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
  (* By connecting these explanations, we can infer that Dasatinib may be effective in treating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "EffectiveInTreating x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
