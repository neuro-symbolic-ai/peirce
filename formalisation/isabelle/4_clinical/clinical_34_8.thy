(* Explanation 1: There exists a patient with hepatoblastoma who has the CTNNB1 W25_H36del mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Mutation z ∧ CTNNB1_W25_H36del z ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e z ∧ With x y"

(* Explanation 2: The CTNNB1 W25_H36del mutation is an activating mutation in the CTNNB1 gene. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. CTNNB1_W25_H36del x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Activating x ∧ Gene y ∧ CTNNB1 y ⟶ In x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have a patient x, a mutation y, an activating mutation y, and CTNNB1 z. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides the existence of a patient with hepatoblastoma who has the CTNNB1 W25_H36del mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that the CTNNB1 W25_H36del mutation is an activating mutation in the CTNNB1 gene. *)
  (* We need to show that this patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  (* From explanation_2, we have the implication that if CTNNB1_W25_H36del x, Mutation x, Activating x, Gene y, and CTNNB1 y, then In x y. *)
  (* Since we have Activating y and CTNNB1 z, we can infer In y z. *)
  then have "In y z" sledgehammer
  (* Now, we need to show the existence of an event e such that Has e, Agent e x, and Agent e y. *)
  (* From explanation_1, we know there exists such an event e. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain e where "Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
