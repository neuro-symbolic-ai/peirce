(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ HER2_Positive y ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ With x y ∧ HER2_Amplification z ⟶ Implies y z"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which implies V777L HER2 mutated status. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Known_V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated_Status z ⟶ Implies y z"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation is associated with breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. V777L_HER2_Mutation x ∧ BreastCancer y ⟶ AssociatedWith x y"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2_Amplification x ∧ CertainTypes_BreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated y ∧ HER2_Amplified z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ Has x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by auto
  (* We need to establish that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation: Implies(C, D), Implies(patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, V777L HER2 mutated status) *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation: Implies(D, E), Implies(V777L HER2 mutated status, V777L HER2 mutation is associated with breast cancer) *)
  (* By combining these, we can derive: Implies(C, E), Implies(patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, V777L HER2 mutation is associated with breast cancer) *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation: Implies(A, B), Implies(patient has HER2+ breast cancer, HER2 amplification) *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides a logical relation: Implies(B, F), Implies(HER2 amplification, HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer) *)
  (* By combining these, we can derive: Implies(A, F), Implies(patient has HER2+ breast cancer, HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer) *)
  (* We can now infer that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  then have "V777L_HER2_Mutated y ∧ HER2_Amplified z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ Has x z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
