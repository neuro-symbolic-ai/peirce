(* Explanation 1: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suitable e ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257 study is only available in Canada *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e. CFI402257Study x ∧ Available e ∧ Patient e x ∧ In x Canada"

(* Explanation 3: The patient is not currently in Canada, and since the study is only available in Canada, they will have to travel for treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e1 e2. Patient x ∧ ¬In x Canada ∧ CFI402257Study y ∧ Available e1 ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y Canada ∧ Travel e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ For e2 Treatment"

(* Explanation 4: If the patient has to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for them *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x e1 e2. (Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ For e1 Treatment) ⟶ (¬Suitable e2 ∧ Patient e2 x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
  shows "∃x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ ¬Suitable e2 ∧ Patient e2 x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 3 states that if the patient is not currently in Canada, they will have to travel for treatment. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(Not(C), D) to infer that the patient has to travel for treatment. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃x y e1 e2. Patient x ∧ ¬In x Canada ∧ CFI402257Study y ∧ Available e1 ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y Canada ∧ Travel e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ For e2 Treatment" <ATP>
  then have "Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ For e1 Treatment" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 4 states that if the patient has to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for them. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(D, E) to infer that it may not be suitable for the patient. *)
  from explanation_4 have "∀x e1 e2. (Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ For e1 Treatment) ⟶ (¬Suitable e2 ∧ Patient e2 x)" <ATP>
  then have "¬Suitable e2 ∧ Patient e2 x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
