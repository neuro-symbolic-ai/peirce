(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ Mutation w ∧ Activating w ∧ In w CTNNB1 ∧ Has z w ∧ Effective x z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective x z"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know there exists a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x y where "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y" by blast
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y z w. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ Mutation w ∧ Activating w ∧ In w CTNNB1 ∧ Has z w ∧ Effective x z" by blast
  (* Since we have a patient z, we can infer that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective x z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
