(* Explanation 1: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ⟶ RelevantFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: NCT03568656 is available for patients who have advanced solid tumours *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour y ⟶ AvailableFor x y"

(* Explanation 3: The patient has soft tissue sarcoma, which is a type of advanced solid tumour, and this condition makes the patient eligible for trials available for advanced solid tumours *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma y ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour y ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Condition z ∧ Makes e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ EligibleFor x Trials ∧ AvailableFor Trials AdvancedSolidTumours"

(* Explanation 4: Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of advanced solid tumour *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. SoftTissueSarcoma x ⟶ AdvancedSolidTumour x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may be eligible for NCT03568656 *)
  shows "∀x y. Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y ⟶ EligibleFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and NCT03568656. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y" by auto
  (* Explanation 2 states that NCT03568656 is available for patients who have advanced solid tumours. *)
  (* Explanation 3 and 4 together imply that having soft tissue sarcoma makes the patient eligible for trials available for advanced solid tumours. *)
  (* Explanation 4 states that soft tissue sarcoma is a type of advanced solid tumour. *)
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(D, E), we can infer that the patient is eligible for trials available for advanced solid tumours. *)
  from explanation_4 have "SoftTissueSarcoma x ⟶ AdvancedSolidTumour x" by blast
  from explanation_3 have "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma y ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour y ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Condition z ∧ Makes e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ EligibleFor x Trials ∧ AvailableFor Trials AdvancedSolidTumours" by blast
  then have "EligibleFor x Trials" sledgehammer
  (* Since NCT03568656 is available for patients with advanced solid tumours, and the patient is eligible for trials available for advanced solid tumours, we can conclude that the patient is eligible for NCT03568656. *)
