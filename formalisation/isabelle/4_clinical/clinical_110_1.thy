(* Explanation 1: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y"

(* Explanation 2: ERBB2 is altered in 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 41% of all breast carcinoma patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. ERBB2 x ∧ BreastCarcinomaPatient y ∧ Altered e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Present e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient y ∧ V777L z ∧ ERBB2 z"

(* Explanation 3: If a patient has a specific mutation, such as V777L HER 2, it is considered a known mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. (Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Specific y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y) ⟶ Known y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient and the mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 provides the existence of such a mutation event. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃e. Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 3 states that if a patient has a specific mutation, it is considered a known mutation. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that the mutation is known. *)
  from explanation_3 have "(Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y) ⟶ Known y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  then have "Known y" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
