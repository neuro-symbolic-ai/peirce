(* Explanation 1: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutations y ∧ PI3KAKTPathway z ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ In y z ∧ Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Survival y"

(* Explanation 2: Treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant directly targets the PIK3CA mutation and is beneficial for patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously, as it prolongs progression-free survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. Treatment x ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Patients z ∧ PIK3CAMutated z ∧ HRPositive z ∧ HER2Negative z ∧ AdvancedBreastCancer z ∧ EndocrineTherapy w ∧ Targets e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Directly e1 ∧ Beneficial e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient z ∧ Received e3 ∧ Agent e3 z ∧ Patient w ∧ Previously e3 ∧ Prolongs e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ ProgressionFreeSurvival y"

(* Explanation 3: Patients who have previously received endocrine therapy and have PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant, which targets the PIK3CA mutation and improves outcomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. Patients x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ PIK3CAMutated x ∧ HRPositive x ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ AdvancedBreastCancer x ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ PIK3CAMutation w ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Previously e1 ∧ Benefit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ From e2 z ∧ Targets e3 ∧ Agent e3 z ∧ Patient w ∧ Improves e3 ∧ Outcomes w"

(* Explanation 4: Patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ⟶ LessSensitive x y"

(* Explanation 5: Patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who have previously received endocrine therapy benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant, as it targets the PIK3CA mutation and improves outcomes. *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 6: Treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant is specifically beneficial for patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, as it directly targets the PIK3CA mutation and improves outcomes for those who have previously received endocrine therapy. *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Previously e1"
  (* Hypothesis: If patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  shows "∀x y z e1 e2. (Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Previously e1) ⟶ (Benefit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ From e2 z ∧ Target e2 ∧ PIK3CAMutation z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient and their previous endocrine therapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Previously e1" by meson
  (* Explanation 5 and 6 provide relevant information about the treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant. *)
  (* Explanation 5: Patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who have previously received endocrine therapy benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant, as it targets the PIK3CA mutation and improves outcomes. *)
  (* Explanation 6: Treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant is specifically beneficial for patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, as it directly targets the PIK3CA mutation and improves outcomes for those who have previously received endocrine therapy. *)
  (* Logical relation: Implies(D, F) and Implies(D, E) *)
  (* We can infer that if a patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target the PIK3CA mutation. *)
  then have "Benefit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ From e2 z ∧ Target e2 ∧ PIK3CAMutation z" sledgehammer
