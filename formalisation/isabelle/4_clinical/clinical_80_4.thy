(* Explanation 1: The patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, and this inappropriateness implies that they are also not appropriate for PARP inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ⟶ (¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ (¬AppropriateFor x y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x z))"

(* Explanation 2: No PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor y x"

(* Explanation 3: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y ⟶ ConsideredFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x is a patient with TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by auto
  (* We need to show that the patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides that if a patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, they are also not appropriate for PARP inhibitors. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that no PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient. *)
  (* Using Explanation 2, we can infer that ¬AppropriateFor x z for any PARPInhibitors z. *)
  have "∀z. PARPInhibitors z ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x z" by (simp add: assms explanation_2)
  (* From Explanation 1, if ¬AppropriateFor x y, then ¬AppropriateFor x z. *)
  (* Since we have ¬AppropriateFor x z, we can infer ¬AppropriateFor x y for any Immunotherapy y. *)
  have "∀y. Immunotherapy y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y" sledgehammer
  (* Combining these, we have that for any y and z, if Immunotherapy y or PARPInhibitors z, then ¬AppropriateFor x y and ¬AppropriateFor x z. *)
  then show "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
