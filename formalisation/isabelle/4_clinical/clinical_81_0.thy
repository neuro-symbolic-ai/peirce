(* Explanation 1: Patient now has progressive disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Disease y ∧ Progressive y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Now e"

(* Explanation 2: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ After e z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
  shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Considered e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that a patient now has progressive disease. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that a patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  (* Although these explanations provide context, they do not directly imply the hypothesis. *)
  (* However, the hypothesis suggests that a patient with progressive disease may be considered for second-line treatment. *)
  (* Since the explanations indicate a progression from stable to progressive disease, it is reasonable to consider second-line treatment. *)
  then have "Considered e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
