(* Explanation 1: Patient has hepatoblastoma with a mutation CTNNB1 W25_H36del. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Mutation z ∧ CTNNB1_W25_H36del z ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ With y z"

(* Explanation 2: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CTNNB1_W25_H36del x ⟶ (Mutation x ∧ Activating x)"

(* Explanation 3: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is within the CTNNB1 gene. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. CTNNB1_W25_H36del x ∧ CTNNB1 y ⟶ Within x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, mutation, activating mutation, and CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that CTNNB1 W25_H36del is within the CTNNB1 gene. *)
  (* We need to show that the mutation y is within the CTNNB1 gene z. *)
  (* Since we have Mutation y and Activating y, we can infer that y is CTNNB1_W25_H36del. *)
  (* From Explanation 3, we know that CTNNB1_W25_H36del is within CTNNB1, so In y z holds. *)
  then have "In y z" sledgehammer
  (* We also need to show that there exists an event e such that Has e, Agent e x, and Patient y. *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we know that there exists such an event e. *)
  then have "∃e. Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
