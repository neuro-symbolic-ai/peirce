(* Explanation 1: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ CheckpointInhibitorAnticancerDrugs x"

(* Explanation 2: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs have started to make progress in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with promising outcomes both in the early and the metastatic setting. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w u v e1 e2. PD1PDL1Drugs x ∧ Progress y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Outcomes w ∧ Promising w ∧ EarlySetting u ∧ MetastaticSetting v ∧ Started e1 ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ With y w ∧ In w u ∧ In w v"

(* Explanation 3: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "TNBC z"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  shows "∃x y e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that PD-1/PD-L1 drugs have promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain x y w e1 e2 where
    "PD1PDL1Drugs x ∧ Progress y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Outcomes w ∧ Promising w ∧ Started e1 ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ With y w" sledgehammer
  (* From Explanation 3, we know that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  then have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x" <ATP>
  (* We have Outcomes w and Promising w from Explanation 2. *)
  then have "Outcomes w ∧ Promising w" <ATP>
  (* We also have TNBC z from the assumption. *)
  from asm have "TNBC z" <ATP>
  (* Combine the information to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
