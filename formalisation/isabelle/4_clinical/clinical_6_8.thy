(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ GenomicInstability y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. GenomicInstability x ∧ Cancer y ⟶ HallmarkOf x y"

(* Explanation 3: Increased genomic instability can lead to the development of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. GenomicInstability x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ Lead e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  shows "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about LossOfBRCA2, CancerDevelopment, and GenomicInstability. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a causal link between LossOfBRCA2 and GenomicInstability. *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides a causal link between GenomicInstability and CancerDevelopment. *)
  (* We need to establish a causal chain that links LossOfBRCA2 to CancerDevelopment via GenomicInstability. *)
  (* Using the logical relations, we can infer that LossOfBRCA2 leads to CancerDevelopment via GenomicInstability. *)
  then have "∃e. Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
