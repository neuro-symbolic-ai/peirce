(* Explanation 1: Overexpression of a HER2 V777L mutation resulted in trastuzumab resistance by a soft-agar colony formation assay of a colorectal cancer cell line. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Overexpression x ∧ HER2V777LMutation x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Assay z ∧ SoftAgarColonyFormation z ∧ CancerCellLine z ∧ Colorectal z ∧ Result e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Method e z"

(* Explanation 2: A portion of tumours, however, ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Tumour x ∧ Portion x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntiHER2AntibodyTherapy y ∧ Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. PatientEntity x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Source e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PatientEntity x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. PatientEntity x ∧ Resistance y ∧ TrastuzumabTherapy y ∧ Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient entity. *)
  from asm have "PatientEntity x" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that a portion of tumours ultimately develop resistance to anti-HER2 antibody therapy. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that a patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(Not(C), D), which implies that if tumours do not develop resistance, the patient may benefit from Trastuzumab. *)
  (* However, we are interested in the case where resistance develops, which is directly stated in Explanation 2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
  then have "∃y e. Resistance y ∧ TrastuzumabTherapy y ∧ Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
