(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ HRR z ∧ InvolvedIn x z"

(* Explanation 2: HRR is a DSB DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z w. HRR x ∧ DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y ∧ DamagedDNA z ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules w ∧ Replaced z w ∧ (From w SisterChromatids ∨ From w PaternalMaternalCopies)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ DSB_DNA_Break_Repair z"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  shows "∀x y z. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ DSB_DNA_Break_Repair z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ Via z y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRCA2, HumanProtein, and DSB_DNA_Break_Repair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ DSB_DNA_Break_Repair z" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides that BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
  from explanation_1 have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ HRR z ∧ InvolvedIn x z" by presburger
  (* Explanation 2 provides that HRR is a DSB DNA repair process. *)
  from explanation_2 have "HRR x ∧ DSB_DNA_Repair_Process y" by blast
  (* Since HRR is a DSB DNA repair process, we can infer that BRCA2 is involved in DSB DNA break repair via HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x z ∧ Via z y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
