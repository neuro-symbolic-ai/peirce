(* Explanation 1: MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ⟶ UnavailableIn x y"

(* Explanation 2: If MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country, then any treatment involving a MEK inhibitor is unavailable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. (MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ∧ UnavailableIn x y) ⟶ (Treatment z ∧ Involves z x ⟶ UnavailableFor z y)"

(* Explanation 3: If MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country, then any specific combination treatment involving a MEK inhibitor, such as the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z w. (MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ∧ UnavailableIn x y) ⟶ (CombinationTreatment z ∧ Involves z x ∧ Vemurafenib w ∧ Involves z w ⟶ UnavailableFor z y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
  shows "∀x y. Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ⟶ UnavailableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Vemurafenib and MEKInhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country. *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation Implies(A, C), which states that if MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country, then any specific combination treatment involving a MEK inhibitor, such as the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for the patient. *)
  (* Since we have Vemurafenib x and MEKInhibitor y, we can apply this logical relation. *)
  then have "UnavailableFor x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
