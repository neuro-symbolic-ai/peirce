(* Explanation 1: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, initiating the synthesis of PAR, which is crucial for recruiting repair proteins *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SS_DNA_Damage z ∧ Detects e1 ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Initiating e3 ∧ Synthesis e3 z ∧ Recruits e4 ∧ CrucialFor e3 e4"

(* Explanation 2: The synthesis of PAR by PARP1 recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage, facilitating the recognition and repair process *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Synthesis e1 x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Repair_Proteins z ∧ Recruits e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Sites_Event e1 x ∧ Facilitating e2 ∧ RecognitionRepair e2 x"

(* Explanation 3: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage, particularly in SS DNA damage repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. Recruitment x ∧ Repair_Proteins y ∧ PARP1 x ∧ Essential e ∧ RecognitionRepair e y ∧ Particularly e z"

(* Explanation 4: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 directly facilitates the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage, making PARP1 involved in this process *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e1 e2. Recruitment x ∧ Repair_Proteins y ∧ PARP1 x ∧ Facilitates e1 ∧ RecognitionRepair e1 z ∧ Directly e1 ∧ Involved e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Process e2 e1"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair *)
  shows "∃x y e. PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RecognitionRepair e y"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have PARP1 x and DNA_Damage y. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y" by blast
  (* We need to show that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  (* From the derived implications, we have Implies(A, G), which means if PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, then PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides that PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, which implies A. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SS_DNA_Damage z ∧ Detects e1 ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Initiating e3 ∧ Synthesis e3 z ∧ Recruits e4 ∧ CrucialFor e3 e4" sledgehammer
  (* From this, we can infer that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
  then have "∃x y e. PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RecognitionRepair e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
