(* Explanation 1: HER2 V777L is coincident with HER2-amplification in breast cancers that have developed trastuzumab resistance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2V777L x ∧ HER2Amplification y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ TrastuzumabResistance e1 ∧ Develop e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ CoincidentWith x y ∧ In y z"

(* Explanation 2: This patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. (Resistance x ∧ TrastuzumabTherapy y) ⟶ (Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy y"
  (* Hypothesis: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to antibody therapy *)
  shows "∃x y e. (HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy y) ⟶ (Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about HER2V777L, Resistance, and AntibodyTherapy. *)
  from asm have "HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy y" by simp
  (* We have a derived implication Implies(A, C), which states that if HER2 V777L is coincident with HER2-amplification in breast cancers, then this patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
  (* Since we have HER2V777L x, we can infer that this patient may develop resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. *)
  then have "Develop e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that HER2 V777L may cause resistance to antibody therapy. *)
  (* Since we have inferred that the patient may develop resistance, we can conclude that HER2 V777L may cause resistance to antibody therapy. *)
  then have "Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
