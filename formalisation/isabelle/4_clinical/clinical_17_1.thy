(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ BRCA2Protein y ⟶ Encodes x y"

(* Explanation 2: The BRCA2 protein, encoded by the BRCA2 gene, is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. BRCA2Protein x ∧ BRCA2Gene y ∧ EncodedBy x y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z ⟶ InvolvedIn x z"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ⟶ TumourSuppressor x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z ⟶ Encodes x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRCA2, HumanProtein, and HomologousRecombinationRepair. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z" by auto
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), which is Implies(BRCA2 is a human gene, encodes the BRCA2 protein). *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer that it encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
  then have "Encodes x y" sledgehammer
  
  (* Explanation 2 states that the BRCA2 protein, encoded by the BRCA2 gene, is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(B, C), which is Implies(encodes the BRCA2 protein, BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair). *)
  (* Since we have Encodes x y, we can infer that the BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn y z" <ATP>
  
  (* Now we have all the components to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
