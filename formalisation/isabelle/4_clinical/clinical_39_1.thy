(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, blocking the activity of CTNNB1 can reduce the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1, potentially making TTK inhibitors effective in such patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ CTNNB1 y ∧ TTKInhibitor z ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PatientEvent e1 y ∧ Block e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Activity e3 ∧ CTNNB1 y ∧ Reduce e4 ∧ Agent e4 z ∧ PatientEvent e4 y ∧ EffectiveIn z x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the explanation, we know that if a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, TTK inhibitors are effective in such patients. *)
  (* We have the derived implication: Implies(A, D), which states that if a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, TTK inhibitors are effective in patients with activating mutations in CTNNB1. *)
  (* From the explanation, we also know that there exists a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x z where "Patient x ∧ TTKInhibitor z ∧ EffectiveIn z x" sledgehammer
  (* Since we have Patient y from the assumption, we can conclude that a TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
