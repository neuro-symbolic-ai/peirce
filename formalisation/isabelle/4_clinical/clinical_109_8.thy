(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ HER2_Positive y ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ With x y ∧ (HER2_Amplification z ⟶ Implies y z)"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which directly implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer, and this is associated with the patient having a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ Has x y ∧ (V777L_HER2_Mutated z ∧ HER2_Amplification w ⟶ Implies y z ∧ Implies y w) ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ BreastCancer w ∧ SpecificType z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ CharacterizedBy z w ∧ AssociatedWith z x"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation is associated with a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and implies HER2 amplification in such cases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. V777L_HER2_Mutation x ∧ SpecificType y ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ CharacterizedBy y x ∧ HER2_Amplification z ∧ CharacterizedBy y z ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ (Implies x z ∧ InSuchCases z)"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2_Amplification x ∧ CertainTypes y ∧ BreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

(* Explanation 5: A patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and this specific type of breast cancer inherently includes both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and is associated with the patient having breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ With x y ∧ SpecificType z ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ HER2_Amplification w ∧ CharacterizedBy z w ∧ Has x z ∧ Includes z y ∧ Includes z w ∧ AssociatedWith z x ∧ BreastCancer w"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutated y ∧ HER2_Amplified z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ Has x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 2 provides that a patient with a known V777L HER2 mutation implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* It also associates this with a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of such a mutation and amplification for the patient. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain y z w where
    "Patient x ∧ V777L_HER2_Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ Has x y ∧ (V777L_HER2_Mutated z ∧ HER2_Amplification w ⟶ Implies y z ∧ Implies y w) ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ BreastCancer w ∧ SpecificType z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ CharacterizedBy z w ∧ AssociatedWith z x" sledgehammer
  
  (* From the above, we have V777L_HER2_Mutated z and HER2_Amplification w, which implies the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  then have "V777L_HER2_Mutated z ∧ HER2_Amplification w ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ BreastCancer w ∧ Has x z ∧ Has x w" <ATP>
  
  (* We need to show the existence of such entities y and z that satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
