(* Explanation 1: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y ∧ ConsideredFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: Unknown whether patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y ∧ Unknown (AppropriateFor x y)"

(* Explanation 3: PARP inhibitors not appropriate for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor y x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x is a patient with TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 states that PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃y. PARPInhibitors y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x y" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, for any z, if z is a PARP inhibitor, then it is not appropriate for x. *)
  then have "∀z. PARPInhibitors z ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 2 states that it is unknown whether the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃y. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y ∧ Unknown (AppropriateFor x y)" <ATP>
  (* Since it is unknown, we cannot conclude that it is appropriate, so we assume it is not appropriate. *)
  then have "∀y. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y" <ATP>
  (* Combining both results, we have that for any y and z, if y is immunotherapy or z is a PARP inhibitor, then neither is appropriate for x. *)
  then have "∀y z. (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
