(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 causes increased genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ GenomicInstability y ∧ Causes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. GenomicInstability x ∧ Cancer y ⟶ HallmarkOf x y"

(* Explanation 3: Increased genomic instability can lead to the development of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. GenomicInstability x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ Lead e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 4: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development by causing genomic instability, which in turn leads to cancer development. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Causes e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Lead e3 ∧ Agent e3 z ∧ Patient e3 y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  shows "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about LossOfBRCA2, CancerDevelopment, and GenomicInstability. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z" by fastforce
  (* Explanation 4 directly relates LossOfBRCA2, CancerDevelopment, and GenomicInstability with the Drives relation. *)
  (* It states that LossOfBRCA2 drives cancer development by causing genomic instability, which in turn leads to cancer development. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of an event e such that Drives e, Agent e x, Patient e y, and Via e z. *)
  then have "∃e. Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z" sledgehammer
