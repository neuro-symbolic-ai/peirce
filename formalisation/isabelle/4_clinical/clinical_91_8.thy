(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, specifically through disrupting polyADP-ribosylation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ AnticancerAgents y ∧ Defects z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In z w ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Role y ∧ Recovery w ∧ Through e2 w ∧ Disrupt e2"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Process e z ∧ Crucial z ∧ Recovery z"

(* Explanation 3: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly interferes with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Role z ∧ Recovery w ∧ Interfere e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Directly e1 ∧ With e1 z ∧ Mechanism e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Defects w"

(* Explanation 4: Interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage is a mechanism by which [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ Role y ∧ Recovery z ∧ Interfere e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ With e1 y ∧ Mechanism e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Defects z"

(* Explanation 5: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly leads to the inhibition of the recovery process from DNA damage, thereby targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. Inhibitors x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Recovery z ∧ Process e3 w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Directly e2 ∧ Inhibition e2 z ∧ Target e3 ∧ Defects w ∧ Through e3 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about inhibitors, defects, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation that [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Explanation 4 states that interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage is a mechanism by which [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(B, A) from Explanation 1 and Explanation 4 to infer the target event. *)
  then have "∃e. Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
