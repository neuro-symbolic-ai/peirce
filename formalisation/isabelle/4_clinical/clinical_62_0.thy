(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene y ∧ BRCA2Protein z ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ⟶ (x = y)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ (x = y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ (x = y)"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have BRCA2 x and HumanProtein y. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y" by simp
  (* We need to show that BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that if BRCA2Protein x and TumourSuppressor y and InvolvedIn y HRR, then x = y. *)
  (* We can use this to show that BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
  have "BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ (x = y)" using explanation_2 by blast
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x and HumanProtein y, we can infer that BRCA2 is involved in HRR. *)
