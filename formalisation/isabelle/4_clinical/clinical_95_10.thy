(* Explanation 1: Patients with V600E mutation could receive treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ V600EMutation y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ With z y"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. RapidRecovery x ∧ MAPKPathway y ∧ Associated x y ∧ Resistance y ∧ BRAFInhibitors y"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ RapidRecovery y ∧ MAPKPathway z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Overcoming e2 z ∧ Resistance z ∧ BRAFInhibitors z"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than vemurafenib monotherapy, and this effectiveness directly leads to better clinical outcomes and better results than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e1 e2. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcoming e1 y ∧ Resistance y ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Than y z ∧ Effectiveness w ∧ Leads e2 ∧ Agent e2 w ∧ ClinicalOutcomes y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Than y z"

(* Explanation 5: Better clinical outcomes from combination therapies often yield better results than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e. ClinicalOutcomes x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Than y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Than y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, H), Implies(Combination therapies are used, Better results than monotherapy are achieved) *)
  (* F is from explanatory sentence 4, H is from explanatory sentence 4 and 5. *)
  (* Since we have Combination x, we can infer BetterResults y. *)
  then have "BetterResults y" sledgehammer
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(F, G), Implies(Combination therapies are used, Better clinical outcomes are achieved) *)
  (* Since we have Combination x, we can infer Better clinical outcomes are achieved, which implies BetterResults y. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Than y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
