(* Explanation 1: PARP2 encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 2 protein, which contains a catalytic domain capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. PARP2 x ∧ Protein y ∧ CatalyticDomain z ∧ Encodes x y ∧ Contains y z ∧ CapableOf z e ∧ Catalyzing e"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferase which, via polyADP-ribosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w p. PARP1 x ∧ Transferase y ∧ NuclearProtein z ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation w ∧ Is x y ∧ Modifies x z ∧ Via z w ∧ InvolvedIn z p ∧ Important p ∧ Recovery p"

(* Explanation 3: PolyADP-ribosylation, involving both PARP1 and PARP2, is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w r. PolyADP_Ribosylation x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ NuclearProtein w ∧ InvolvedIn x y ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ Crucial x ∧ Modifying x w ∧ PlayRole w r ∧ Recovery r"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
  shows "∃x y z. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z ∧ Process z ∧ Recovery z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about PARP1 and PARP2. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 states that PolyADP-ribosylation involves both PARP1 and PARP2 and is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This directly relates to logical proposition E and F. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, F), Implies(PolyADP-ribosylation involves both PARP1 and PARP2, crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage). *)
  (* From explanation 3, we can infer the involvement of PARP1 and PARP2 in PolyADP-ribosylation and its importance in recovery processes. *)
  then have "∃z. PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Crucial z ∧ Modifying z w ∧ PlayRole w r ∧ Recovery r" sledgehammer
  (* Since Crucial implies Important and Modifying implies Process, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
