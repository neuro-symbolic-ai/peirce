(* Explanation 1: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Suitable e ∧ Agent e y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257 study is only in Canada *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. CFI402257Study x ∧ Canada y ∧ In x y"

(* Explanation 3: The patient is not currently in Canada *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Canada y ∧ ¬In x y"

(* Explanation 4: If the patient has to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for them *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ (Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ For e1 y ⟶ ¬Suitable e2 ∧ Agent e2 x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
  shows "∃x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ ¬Suitable e2 ∧ Agent e2 x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 states that the patient is not currently in Canada. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃y. Canada y ∧ ¬In x y" sledgehammer
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(Not(C), D), we can infer that the patient has to travel for treatment. *)
  then have "Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 4 provides that if the patient has to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for them. *)
  from explanation_4 have "∀e2. ¬Suitable e2 ∧ Agent e2 x" <ATP>
  (* Combining these, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
