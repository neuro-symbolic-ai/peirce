(* Explanation 1: PARP1 synthesis PAR which recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2 x y z. Synthesis e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PAR y ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Recruit e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Repair_Proteins z ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Sites_DNA_Damage z ∧ PARP1 x"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃e1 e2 x y. Detects e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Sites_SS_DNA_Damage y ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ PARP1 x"

(* Explanation 3: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage, particularly in SS DNA damage repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e x y z. Recruitment e ∧ Repair_Proteins y ∧ Agent e y ∧ PARP1 z ⟶ (Essential e ∧ Recognition y ∧ Repair y ∧ DNA_Damage y ∧ SS_DNA_Damage_Repair y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  shows "∃e x y. Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Recognition y ∧ Repair y ∧ DNA_Damage y ∧ SS_DNA_Damage_Repair y ∧ PARP1 x"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have PARP1 x. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" by simp
  (* According to explanation_2, PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain e1 e2 y where "Detects e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Sites_SS_DNA_Damage y ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ PARP1 x" sledgehammer
  (* From the logical relation Implies(C, D), we know that if PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, then the recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage. *)
  then have "The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage" <ATP>
  (* From the logical relation Implies(D, E), we know that if the recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage, then recognition and repair of DNA damage, particularly in SS DNA damage repair, occurs. *)
  then have "Recognition and repair of DNA damage, particularly in SS DNA damage repair" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
