(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HER2Positive y ∧ With x y ∧ (HER2Amplification z ⟶ Implies y z)"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which directly implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer, and this is associated with the patient having breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ HER2Amplification w ∧ Has x y ∧ (Implies y z ∧ V777LHER2Mutated z ∧ Implies y w ∧ InContext y z) ∧ AssociatedWith y z"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation is associated with breast cancer and implies HER2 amplification in such cases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. V777LHER2Mutation x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ HER2Amplification z ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ (Implies x z ∧ InCases x y)"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2Amplification x ∧ BreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

(* Explanation 5: A patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and this specific type of breast cancer is associated with the patient having breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ HER2Amplification w ∧ Has x z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ CharacterizedBy z w ∧ AssociatedWith z x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 provides that a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, D) and Implies(C, B) from Explanation 2. *)
  (* Since Explanation 2 also associates the V777L HER2 mutation with breast cancer, we can infer the necessary conditions. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain z w where "V777LHER2Mutation z ∧ HER2Amplification w ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 5 states that a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* This specific type of breast cancer is associated with the patient having breast cancer. *)
  from explanation_5 obtain z w where "CharacterizedBy y z ∧ CharacterizedBy y w ∧ AssociatedWith y x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  then have "V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
