(* Explanation 1: Patient does not have BRCA mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ BRCAMutation y ⟶ ¬Have x y"

(* Explanation 2: Olaparib and talazoparib are licensed PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER-2-negative advanced or metastatic BC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. (Olaparib x ∨ Talazoparib x) ∧ PARPInhibitor x ∧ Licensed x ∧ Patient y ∧ BRCAMutated y ∧ HER2Negative y ∧ (AdvancedBC z ∨ MetastaticBC z) ⟶ TreatmentFor x y"

(* Explanation 3: PARP inhibitors are only appropriate for patients with a BRCA mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PARPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ BRCAMutation y ⟶ AppropriateFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors not appropriate for this patient *)
  shows "∀x y. PARPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about PARP inhibitors and the patient. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that patients do not have BRCA mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that PARP inhibitors are only appropriate for patients with a BRCA mutation. *)
  (* Since the patient does not have a BRCA mutation, we can infer that PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  then have "¬BRCAMutation y" sledgehammer
  (* Using explanation 3, we can conclude that PARP inhibitors are not appropriate for this patient. *)
  then have "¬AppropriateFor x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
