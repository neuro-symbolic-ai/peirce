(* Explanation 1: Patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Common y ∧ BRAF_V600E y ∧ Has e x ∧ Agent e y"

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ LowMolecularWeight y ∧ OrallyAvailable y ∧ Binds e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PatientEvent e1 z ∧ ATPBindingSite z ∧ BRAF_V600E z ∧ Inhibits e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Activity e2"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ BRAF_V600E y ∧ Candidate x ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ For z x"

(* Explanation 4: Candidates for treatment with vemurafenib have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. Candidate x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Potential e ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e z ∧ AsOption y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y V600E"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, treatment, and vemurafenib. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* Explanation 4 states that candidates for treatment with vemurafenib have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
  (* Using the derived implication Implies(A, D), we can infer that a patient with a BRAF V600E mutation has the potential to receive vemurafenib. *)
  then have "∃e. Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y V600E" sledgehammer
