(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain should overcome trastuzumab resistance that has been induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ TargetedTo x y ∧ HER2_Kinase_Domain y ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Trastuzumab_Resistance z ∧ InducedBy z HER2_Activating_Mutation"

(* Explanation 2: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. HER2_V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor can overcome the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, and this action directly contributes to overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Resistance z ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Contribute e2 y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"

(* Explanation 4: Overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation implies overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y e1 e2. Resistance x ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Treatment_Resistance y ⟶ Overcome e2 ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about targeting, HER V777L mutation, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, irreversibility, and treatment resistance. *)
  from asm have "Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Treatment_Resistance y" by force
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, G), Implies(targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, overcome resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation) *)
  (* F is from explanatory sentence 3, G is from explanatory sentence 3. *)
  (* We already have Targeting x, HER_V777L_Mutation y, Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x, and Irreversible x, so we can infer overcome resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
  then have "Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(I, J), Implies(overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, overcoming treatment resistance) *)
  (* I is from explanatory sentence 4, J is from explanatory sentence 4. *)
  (* We already have Overcome e, so we can infer overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  then have "Overcome e ∧ Treatment_Resistance y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
