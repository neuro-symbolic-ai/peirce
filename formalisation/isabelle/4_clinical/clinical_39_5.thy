(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, blocking the activity of CTNNB1 is necessary to reduce the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1, reducing the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1 is necessary for TTK inhibitors to be effective in patients with such mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ In y z ∧ TTKInhibitor e2 ∧ Block e2 ∧ Activity e3 ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ Necessary e4 ∧ Reduce e4 ∧ Effect e4 ∧ EffectiveIn e4 x"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 and TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, then blocking the activity of CTNNB1 leads to reducing the effects of these mutations, which is necessary for making TTK inhibitors effective in this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3 e4 e5. (Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ In y z ∧ TTKInhibitor e2 ∧ Block e2 ∧ Activity e3 ∧ CTNNB1 z) ⟶ (Block e4 ∧ Activity e4 ∧ CTNNB1 z ⟶ Reduce e5 ∧ Effect e5 ∧ Necessary e5 ∧ EffectiveIn e5 x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides a scenario where a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, and TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, leading to effectiveness. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides a conditional statement that if a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 and TTK inhibitors block the activity, then it leads to effectiveness. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations derived from the explanations to infer the effectiveness of TTK inhibitors. *)
  (* Using the derived implication: Implies(A, E), Implies(patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, TTK inhibitors are effective in patients with such mutations) *)
  (* Since Explanation 1 implies the existence of such a scenario, we can infer the effectiveness of TTK inhibitors. *)
  then have "∃x. TTKInhibitor x ∧ EffectiveIn x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
