(* Explanation 1: The best known genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. GeneticAlteration x ∧ Known x ⟶ ActivatingPointMutation x ∧ At x PI3K"

(* Explanation 2: In breast cancer, mutations of the PIK3CA gene, specifically PIK3Ca, are highly frequent and are known activating mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Mutation x ∧ Of x PIK3CA ∧ SpecificTo x PIK3Ca ∧ In x BreastCancer ⟶ (Frequent x ∧ KnownActivatingMutation x)"

(* Explanation 3: If a mutation is specific to PIK3Ca, then it is present in breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Mutation x ∧ SpecificTo x PIK3Ca ⟶ PresentIn x BreastCancer"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "SpecificTo x PIK3Ca"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  shows "KnownMutation x ∧ FrequentMutation x ∧ ActivatingMutation x ∧ In x BreastCancer"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information that the mutation is specific to PIK3Ca. *)
  from asm have "SpecificTo x PIK3Ca" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(a mutation is specific to PIK3Ca, a mutation is present in breast cancer) *)
  (* From this, we can infer that the mutation is present in breast cancer. *)
  then have "PresentIn x BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 states that if a mutation is of the PIK3CA gene, specific to PIK3Ca, and in breast cancer, it is frequent and a known activating mutation. *)
  (* Since we have SpecificTo x PIK3Ca and PresentIn x BreastCancer, we can use explanation_2 to infer the rest. *)
  from asm and `PresentIn x BreastCancer` have "Frequent x ∧ KnownActivatingMutation x" <ATP>
  (* We can now conclude that the mutation is known, frequent, and activating in breast cancer. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
