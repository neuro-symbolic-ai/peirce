(* Explanation 1: A patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer has breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)

(* Explanation 2: Triple Negative Breast Cancer is defined by the lack of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ⟶ DefinedBy x (¬Expression ER ∧ ¬Expression PR ∧ ¬Expression HER2)"

(* Explanation 3: If a patient has Triple Negative Breast Cancer, then their breast cancer has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. (Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (BreastCancer z ∧ Has x z ∧ ¬Expression ER ∧ ¬Expression PR ∧ ¬Expression HER2)"

(* Explanation 4: Any breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors is considered Triple Negative Breast Cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. (BreastCancer x ∧ CharacterizedBy x (¬Expression ER ∧ ¬Expression PR ∧ ¬Expression HER2)) ⟶ TripleNegativeBreastCancer x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2. *)
