(* Explanation 1: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. BRAF x ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Regulation e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ PlayRole e ∧ In e z"

(* Explanation 2: A BRAF mutation is a spontaneous change in the BRAF gene that causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. BRAFMutation x ∧ Change y ∧ BRAF y ∧ Gene z ∧ Protein z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ TurnOn e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ KeepOn e3 ∧ Agent e3 z ∧ Patient e3 z"

(* Explanation 3: When the BRAF gene is turned on continuously due to a mutation, it disrupts the normal regulation of MAPK/ERK, which directly affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. BRAF x ∧ Gene y ∧ Mutation z ∧ MAPK_ERK w ∧ CellDivision w ∧ Differentiation w ∧ Secretion w ∧ TurnOn e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Disrupt e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ Affect e3 ∧ Agent e3 w ∧ Patient e3 w"

(* Explanation 4: A BRAF mutation leads to the continuous activation of the BRAF gene, causing a disruption in MAPK/ERK regulation, which in turn directly affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. BRAFMutation x ∧ Activation y ∧ BRAF y ∧ Gene z ∧ MAPK_ERK w ∧ CellDivision w ∧ Differentiation w ∧ Secretion w ∧ Lead e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ Affect e3 ∧ Agent e3 w ∧ Patient e3 w"

(* Explanation 5: The disruption of MAPK/ERK regulation by a BRAF mutation results in an event that affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2. Disruption x ∧ MAPK_ERK y ∧ BRAFMutation z ∧ CellDivision y ∧ Differentiation y ∧ Secretion y ∧ Result e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Affect e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Mutation x ∧ BRAF y"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation and secretion *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Mutation x ∧ BRAF y ∧ CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z ∧ Affect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Mutation and BRAF. *)
  from asm have "Mutation x ∧ BRAF y" by auto
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(C, B), which states that a BRAF mutation implies cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* Explanation 4 and Explanation 5 support this relation. *)
  (* Since we have Mutation x, we can infer cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "CellDivision z ∧ Differentiation z ∧ Secretion z" sledgehammer
  (* We also have a logical relation Implies(C, E), which states that a BRAF mutation implies disruption of MAPK/ERK regulation. *)
  (* Explanation 3 and Explanation 5 support this relation. *)
  (* Since we have Mutation x, we can infer disruption of MAPK/ERK regulation. *)
  then have "Disruption e" <ATP>
  (* From the disruption, we can infer an event that affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "Affect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the inferred information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
