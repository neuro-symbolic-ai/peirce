(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ BRCA2Protein y ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: The BRCA2 protein, encoded by the BRCA2 gene, is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. BRCA2Protein x ∧ BRCA2Gene y ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ HumanProtein x"

(* Explanation 3: The BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor that is involved in chromosomal stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor x ∧ ChromosomalStability y ⟶ InvolvedIn x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ ChromosomeStability y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ ChromosomeStability y ⟶ InvolvedIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about BRCA2, HumanProtein, and ChromosomeStability. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x ∧ ChromosomeStability y" by simp
  (* We have a derived implication: Implies(C, E), which states that if the BRCA2 protein is a human protein, then it is involved in chromosomal stability. *)
  (* Since we have HumanProtein x, we can infer InvolvedIn x y. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
