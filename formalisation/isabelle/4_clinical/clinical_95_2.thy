(* Explanation 1: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y z ∧ V600EMutation z"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling was associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. RapidRecovery x ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling y ∧ Associated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Resistance y ∧ BRAFInhibitors y"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ RapidRecovery y ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Overcoming e2 ∧ Resistance z ∧ BRAFInhibitors z"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Effective x ∧ Overcoming e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Than x z ∧ Monotherapy z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Than y z ∧ Monotherapy z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by blast
  (* Explanation 4 states that combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy. *)
  (* This implies that the combination is more effective than monotherapy, which aligns with the hypothesis. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(E, Not(F)) to infer that the combination is not monotherapy. *)
  then have "Effective x ∧ Overcoming e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Than x z ∧ Monotherapy z" sledgehammer
  (* Since the combination is more effective, it yields better results. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Than y z ∧ Monotherapy z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
