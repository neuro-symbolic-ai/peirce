(* Explanation 1: Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Agent e z"

(* Explanation 2: Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Vinorelbine x ∧ Cisplatin y) ⟶ (Chemotherapy x ∧ Chemotherapy y)"

(* Explanation 3: Vinorelbine and cisplatin, when used as first-line treatments, are considered first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. (Vinorelbine x ∧ Cisplatin y ∧ FirstLineTreatment x ∧ FirstLineTreatment y) ⟶ (FirstLineChemotherapy x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y)"

(* Explanation 4: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Treated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides that the patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain y z e where "Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Agent e z" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 3 states that vinorelbine and cisplatin, when used as first-line treatments, are considered first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "FirstLineChemotherapy y ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy z" <ATP>
  (* Since vinorelbine and cisplatin are considered first-line chemotherapy, they are also chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_2 have "Chemotherapy y ∧ Chemotherapy z" <ATP>
  (* We can now conclude that the patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
