(* Explanation 1: A patient with TNBC has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"

(* Explanation 2: The best response to the first-line chemotherapy treatment in the patient with TNBC was stable disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Response z ∧ Best z ∧ To z y ∧ In z x ∧ Disease z ∧ Stable z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ After e1 e2"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have a patient with TNBC who has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient with TNBC has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 provides that the best response to the first-line chemotherapy treatment in the patient with TNBC was stable disease. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Response z ∧ Best z ∧ To z y ∧ In z x ∧ Disease z ∧ Stable z" by blast
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A and B, C), we can infer the best response was stable disease. *)
  then have "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ After e1 e2" sledgehammer
