(* Explanation 1: CREBBP/ BCORL1 reported in patients with ossifying myxoid tumour *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. CREBBP_BCORL1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Tumour z ∧ OssifyingMyxoid z ∧ Reported e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In y z"

(* Explanation 2: Unknown relevance of CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. CREBBP_BCORL1_Fusion x ⟶ Relevance y ∧ Unknown y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "CREBBP_BCORL1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: CREBBP/BCORL1 potential role in cancer *)
  shows "∀x y. CREBBP_BCORL1 x ∧ Cancer y ⟶ RoleIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about CREBBP/BCORL1. *)
  from asm have "CREBBP_BCORL1 x" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 provides information about CREBBP/BCORL1 being reported in patients with ossifying myxoid tumour. *)
  (* However, this does not directly relate to the hypothesis about the potential role in cancer. *)
  (* Explanation 2 discusses the unknown relevance of CREBBP/BCORL1 fusion, which is also not directly related to the hypothesis. *)
  (* Since there is no direct logical relation or derived implication connecting the premise to the hypothesis, *)
  (* and the explanations do not provide a direct link to the hypothesis, we cannot infer the hypothesis from the given information. *)
  (* Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be proven with the provided axioms and premise. *)
