(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene y ∧ Protein z ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ⟶ (x = y ∧ z = x)"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor that is involved in chromosomal stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor y ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ ChromosomalStability z ⟶ (x = y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ ChromosomeStability z"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ ChromosomeStability z ⟶ (x = y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about BRCA2, HumanProtein, and ChromosomeStability. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ ChromosomeStability z" by auto
  (* Explanation 2 provides a relation between BRCA2 protein, tumor suppressor, and chromosomal stability. *)
  (* We need to show that BRCA2 is involved in chromosome stability. *)
  (* Since BRCA2 is a human protein and involved in chromosome stability, we can use Explanation 2. *)
  then have "BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor y ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ ChromosomalStability z ⟶ (x = y)" using explanation_2 by blast
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
