(* Explanation 1: Patients with V600E mutation could receive treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patients x ∧ V600EMutation x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Recovery x ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling x ∧ Resistance y ∧ BRAFInhibitors y ∧ Associated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ Recovery y ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling y ∧ Resistance z ∧ BRAFInhibitors z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy, and this effectiveness directly leads to better results than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ Resistance z ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcome e1 ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Leads e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ BetterResults e2 ∧ Than e2 z"

(* Explanation 5: Better clinical outcomes from combination therapies often yield better results than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e. ClinicalOutcomes x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(H, I), Implies(Combination therapies are used, Better results than monotherapy are achieved) *)
  (* H is from explanatory sentence 4, I is from explanatory sentence 4. *)
  (* We already have Combination x, so we can infer BetterResults e. *)
  then have "BetterResults e" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(I, J), Implies(Better results than monotherapy are achieved, Better clinical outcomes are achieved) *)
  (* I is from explanatory sentence 4, J is from explanatory sentence 5. *)
  (* We already have BetterResults e, so we can infer Better clinical outcomes are achieved. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
