(* Explanation 1: Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Instrument e y ∧ Instrument e z"

(* Explanation 2: Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Vinorelbine x ∧ Cisplatin y) ⟶ (Chemotherapy x ∧ Chemotherapy y)"

(* Explanation 3: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Treated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Instrument e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Instrument e y"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know that a patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain y z e where "Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ FirstLineTreatment y ∧ FirstLineTreatment z ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Instrument e y ∧ Instrument e z" sledgehammer
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
  then have "Chemotherapy y ∧ Chemotherapy z" <ATP>
  (* Since vinorelbine and cisplatin are chemotherapy treatments and are received as first-line treatment, we can infer that the patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  then have "FirstLine y ∧ FirstLine z" <ATP>
  then have "Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Instrument e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
