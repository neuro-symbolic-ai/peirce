(* Explanation 1: A patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer has breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ CharacterizedBy z AbsenceOfExpression ∧ ER AbsenceOfExpression ∧ PR AbsenceOfExpression ∧ HER2 AbsenceOfExpression"

(* Explanation 2: Triple Negative Breast Cancer is defined by the lack of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ⟶ DefinedBy x LackOfExpression ∧ ER LackOfExpression ∧ PR LackOfExpression ∧ HER2 LackOfExpression"

(* Explanation 3: If a patient has Triple Negative Breast Cancer, then their breast cancer has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. (Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (BreastCancer z ∧ Has z NoExpression ∧ ER NoExpression ∧ PR NoExpression ∧ HER2 NoExpression)"

(* Explanation 4: Any breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors is considered Triple Negative Breast Cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. (BreastCancer x ∧ CharacterizedBy x AbsenceOfExpression ∧ ER AbsenceOfExpression ∧ PR AbsenceOfExpression ∧ HER2 AbsenceOfExpression) ⟶ TripleNegativeBreastCancer x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ Has y z"
  sledgehammer
