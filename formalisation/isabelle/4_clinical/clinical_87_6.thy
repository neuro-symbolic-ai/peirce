(* Explanation 1: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitor x ∨ PDL1Inhibitor x) ⟶ CheckpointInhibitorAnticancerDrug x"

(* Explanation 2: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs have started to make progress in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with promising outcomes both in the early and the metastatic setting. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w a b e1 e2. (PD1Drug x ∨ PDL1Drug x) ∧ Progress y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Outcome w ∧ Promising w ∧ EarlySetting a ∧ MetastaticSetting b ∧ Started e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ In y z ∧ With y w ∧ In w a ∧ In w b"

(* Explanation 3: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitor x ∨ PDL1Inhibitor x) ⟶ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x"

(* Explanation 4: As immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. (PD1Drug x ∨ PDL1Drug x) ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x ∧ Outcome y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"

(* Explanation 5: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, in general, have shown promising outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x ∧ Outcome y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ General x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x ∧ TNBC z"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  shows "∃x y e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x ∧ Outcome y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about immune checkpoint inhibitors and TNBC. *)
  from asm have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x ∧ TNBC z" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, E), which states that PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors being a type of immune checkpoint inhibitors implies that immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* Explanation 5 directly supports the hypothesis that immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of an outcome y that is promising in TNBC. *)
  from explanation_5 obtain y e where "Outcome y ∧ Promising y ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  then have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitor x ∧ Outcome y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
