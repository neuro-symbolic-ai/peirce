(* Explanation 1: PARP2 encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 2 protein, which contains a catalytic domain capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. PARP2 x ∧ Protein y ∧ Encode x y ∧ CatalyticDomain z ∧ Contains y z ∧ (∃e. CapableOf z e ∧ Reaction e)"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferase which, via polyADP-ribosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. PARP1 x ∧ Transferase y ∧ Is x y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ NuclearProtein w ∧ Modifies x w ∧ Via w z ∧ (∃e. InvolvedIn w e ∧ Important e ∧ RecoveryFromDNA e)"

(* Explanation 3: PolyADP-ribosylation, involving both PARP1 and PARP2, is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage and is important for these recovery processes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e. PolyADP_Ribosylation x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ Involving x y ∧ Involving x z ∧ CrucialFor x e ∧ Modifying w ∧ NuclearProtein w ∧ PlayRole w e ∧ Important e ∧ RecoveryProcess e"

(* Explanation 4: PolyADP-ribosylation, involving both PARP1 and PARP2, directly contributes to the recovery from DNA damage by modifying nuclear proteins essential for this process *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e. PolyADP_Ribosylation x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ Involving x y ∧ Involving x z ∧ Contributes x e ∧ Directly x ∧ Modifying w ∧ NuclearProtein w ∧ EssentialFor w e ∧ Process e"

(* Explanation 5: The involvement of both PARP1 and PARP2 in polyADP-ribosylation is important for recovery processes, including recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2. Involvement x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ In x e1 ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation e1 ∧ Important e2 ∧ RecoveryProcess e1 ∧ Including e1 e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z w e. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z ∧ Process w ∧ RecoveryFromDNA w ∧ Including w e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about PARP1, PARP2, and PolyADP-ribosylation. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 3 states that PolyADP-ribosylation involves both PARP1 and PARP2 and is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that both PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in PolyADP-ribosylation, which is important for recovery processes. *)
  (* Explanation 5 further supports that the involvement of both PARP1 and PARP2 in PolyADP-ribosylation is important for recovery processes, including recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 5 also indicates that recovery processes include recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "Process w ∧ RecoveryFromDNA w ∧ Including w e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
