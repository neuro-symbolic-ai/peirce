(* Explanation 1: Patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y"

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ BRAF_V600E_Kinase z ∧ ATP_Binding_Site w ∧ Bind e1 ∧ Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient w ∧ Selectively e1 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient z ∧ To e1 w"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib and have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z v w e1 e2. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Candidate z ∧ Treatment w ∧ Vemurafenib v ∧ Have e1 ∧ Receive e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient z ∧ For e1 w ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient v ∧ As e2 w"

(* Explanation 4: This potential is directly linked to their mutation status. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. Potential x ∧ Mutation_Status y ∧ Linked e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Directly e"

(* Explanation 5: Candidates for treatment with vemurafenib, due to their BRAF V600E mutation, are likely to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w e. Candidate x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation w ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient z ∧ As e y ∧ Likely e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y ∧ Instrument e z ∧ For e V600E_Mutation"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Patient x, Treatment y, and Vemurafenib z. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation, which implies they are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, C), we can infer that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 states that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib and have the potential to receive it. *)
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(C, D), we can infer that patients have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃x y z v w e1 e2. Patient x ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation y ∧ Candidate z ∧ Treatment w ∧ Vemurafenib v ∧ Have e1 ∧ Receive e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient z ∧ For e1 w ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient v ∧ As e2 w" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 5 states that candidates for treatment with vemurafenib are likely to receive it. *)
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(C, F), we can infer that candidates for treatment with vemurafenib are likely to receive it. *)
  from explanation_5 have "∃x y z w e. Candidate x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ BRAF_V600E_Mutation w ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient z ∧ As e y ∧ Likely e" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that a patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
