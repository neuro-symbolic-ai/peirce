(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. (BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ BRCA2Protein y ∧ Encodes e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y)"

(* Explanation 2: The BRCA2 protein, encoded by the BRCA2 gene, is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. (BRCA2Protein x ∧ BRCA2Gene y ∧ Encoded e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ InvolvedInHRR x)"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor x) ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x"

(* Explanation 4: If a protein is encoded by the BRCA2 gene and is a human protein, it is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y e. (Protein x ∧ BRCA2Gene y ∧ Encoded e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e x ∧ HumanProtein x) ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "∀x. (BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x) ⟶ InvolvedInHRR x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about BRCA2 being a human protein. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein x" by auto
  (* Explanation 4 states that if a protein is encoded by the BRCA2 gene and is a human protein, it is involved in HRR. *)
  (* We have HumanProtein x from the premise, and we need to show that it is involved in HRR. *)
  (* Using explanation 4, we can infer that if BRCA2 x is a human protein, it is involved in HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedInHRR x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
