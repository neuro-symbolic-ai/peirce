(* Explanation 1: PARP2 encodes poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase-like 2 protein, which contains a catalytic domain capable of catalyzing a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w. PARP2 x ∧ Protein y ∧ Encode x y ∧ Domain z ∧ Contains y z ∧ Catalytic z ∧ CapableOf z Catalyzing ∧ Reaction w ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation w"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 is a polyADP-ribosyl transferase which, via polyADP-ribosylation, modifies nuclear proteins involved in important cellular processes including recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w v. PARP1 x ∧ Transferase y ∧ Is x y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ NuclearProtein w ∧ Modifies y w ∧ Via z y ∧ Process v ∧ Important v ∧ InvolvedIn w v ∧ RecoveryFromDNA v"

(* Explanation 3: PolyADP-ribosylation, involving both PARP1 and PARP2, is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage and is important for these recovery processes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w v u. PolyADP_Ribosylation x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ InvolvedIn y x ∧ InvolvedIn z x ∧ Crucial x ∧ NuclearProtein w ∧ Modifying w x ∧ Role v ∧ Play w v ∧ RecoveryFromDNA v ∧ Important x ∧ Process u ∧ RecoveryFromDNA u"

(* Explanation 4: PolyADP-ribosylation, involving both PARP1 and PARP2, directly contributes to the recovery from DNA damage by modifying nuclear proteins essential for this process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w v. PolyADP_Ribosylation x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ PARP2 z ∧ InvolvedIn y x ∧ InvolvedIn z x ∧ Contributes x w ∧ Directly x ∧ RecoveryFromDNA w ∧ NuclearProtein v ∧ Modifying v x ∧ Essential v w"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation which is important in processes including recovery from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z w. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z ∧ InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z ∧ Process w ∧ RecoveryFromDNA w ∧ Including w z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about PARP1, PARP2, and PolyADP-ribosylation. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADP_Ribosylation z" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 states that PolyADP-ribosylation involves both PARP1 and PARP2 and is crucial for modifying nuclear proteins that play a role in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies that PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in PolyADP-ribosylation, which is important for recovery processes. *)
  (* Logical relation Implies(F, G) and Implies(G, H) can be used to infer the involvement and importance. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x z ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ Important z" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 4 further supports that PolyADP-ribosylation directly contributes to recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This implies the existence of a process involving recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "Process w ∧ RecoveryFromDNA w ∧ Including w z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
