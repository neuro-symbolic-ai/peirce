(* Explanation 1: Synthetic lethality is when co-occurrence of multiple genetic events results in cell death. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. SyntheticLethality x ∧ CoOccurrence y ∧ GeneticEvent y ∧ ResultIn e ∧ CellDeath z ⟶ (Agent e y ∧ Patient e z)"

(* Explanation 2: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated double strand breaks by preventing single strand break repair, relying on defective homologous recombination repair and error prone non-homologous end joining to repair DNA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z u v w e. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Cause y ∧ ReplicationAssociatedDoubleStrandBreaks z ∧ Prevent e ∧ SingleStrandBreakRepair v ∧ RelyOn w ∧ DefectiveHomologousRecombinationRepair v ∧ ErrorProneNonHomologousEndJoining v ∧ RepairDNA v ⟶ (Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Agent w x ∧ Patient w v)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ∧ SyntheticLethality w"
  (* Hypothesis: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ∧ Inhibition z ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ SyntheticLethality w ∧ RelyOnSingularMechanism w ∧ CumulativeDamageToDNA w"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Patients, LossOfBRCA2, PARPInhibitors, and SyntheticLethality. *)
  from asm have "Patients x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ∧ SyntheticLethality w" by meson
  
  (* Explanation 1 provides a relation between SyntheticLethality and CoOccurrence of genetic events resulting in CellDeath. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that SyntheticLethality implies a reliance on a singular mechanism due to cell death. *)
  from explanation_1 have "SyntheticLethality w ⟶ (Agent e y ∧ Patient e z)" sledgehammer
  
  (* Explanation 2 provides a relation between PARPInhibitors and the prevention of single strand break repair, *)
  (* which relies on defective homologous recombination repair and error-prone non-homologous end joining. *)
  from explanation_2 have "PARPInhibitors z ⟶ (Agent e z ∧ Patient e v ∧ Agent w z ∧ Patient w v)" <ATP>
  
  (* Using the logical relations, we know that PARP inhibitors cause replication-associated double strand breaks, *)
  (* which implies reliance on defective homologous recombination repair and error-prone non-homologous end joining. *)
  from `PARPInhibitors z` have "RelyOnSingularMechanism w" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining these, we can infer that patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality. *)
  have "Inhibition z ∧ Benefit e ∧ CumulativeDamageToDNA w" <ATP>
  
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
