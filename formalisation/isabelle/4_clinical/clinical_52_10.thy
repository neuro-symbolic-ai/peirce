(* Explanation 1: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, initiating the synthesis of PAR, which is crucial for recruiting repair proteins and directly involves PARP1 in the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ Damage z ∧ Detects e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Initiating e3 ∧ Synthesis e3 ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ Crucial e3 ∧ Recruit e4 ∧ Proteins z ∧ Involves e4 ∧ Agent e4 x ∧ RecognitionRepair e4"

(* Explanation 2: The synthesis of PAR by PARP1 recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage, facilitating the recognition and repair process and ensuring PARP1's involvement in this process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. Synthesis e1 ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Proteins z ∧ Recruits e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Sites y ∧ Damage z ∧ Facilitating e2 ∧ RecognitionRepair e2 ∧ Ensuring e3 ∧ Involvement e3 ∧ Agent e3 y"

(* Explanation 3: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage, particularly in SS DNA damage repair, and confirms PARP1's role in this process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e1 e2. Recruitment x ∧ Proteins y ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Essential e1 ∧ RecognitionRepair e1 ∧ Confirms e2 ∧ Role e2 ∧ Agent e2 y"

(* Explanation 4: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 directly facilitates the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage, making PARP1 involved in this process and highlighting its crucial role. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e1 e2 e3. Recruitment x ∧ Proteins y ∧ PARP1 y ∧ Facilitates e1 ∧ RecognitionRepair e1 ∧ Making e2 ∧ Involved e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Highlighting e3 ∧ Role e3 ∧ Crucial e3"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  shows "∃x e. PARP1 x ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ RecognitionRepair e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about PARP1. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation: Implies(A, B), Implies(PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, Synthesis of PAR by PARP1) *)
  (* Explanation 1 also provides: Implies(B, C), Implies(Synthesis of PAR by PARP1, Recruitment of repair proteins) *)
  (* Explanation 1 further provides: Implies(C, D), Implies(Recruitment of repair proteins, Recognition and repair of SS DNA damage) *)
  (* From these, we can derive: Implies(A, D), Implies(PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, Recognition and repair of SS DNA damage) *)
  (* Since we have PARP1 x, we can infer the involvement in recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
  then have "∃e. Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ RecognitionRepair e" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
