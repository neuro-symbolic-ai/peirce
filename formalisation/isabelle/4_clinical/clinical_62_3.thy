(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein, which is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene y ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ BRCA2Protein z ∧ HumanProtein z ⟶ Encode e"

(* Explanation 2: The BRCA2 protein, encoded by the BRCA2 gene, is involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. BRCA2Protein x ∧ BRCA2Gene y ∧ EncodedBy x y ⟶ InvolvedIn x HRR"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor x ⟶ InvolvedIn x HRR"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ InvolvedIn x HRR"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about BRCA2 and HumanProtein. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y" by simp
  (* We need to show that if BRCA2 x and HumanProtein y are involved in HRR, then BRCA2 x is involved in HRR. *)
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that if BRCA2Protein is encoded by BRCA2Gene, it is involved in HRR. *)
  (* From Explanation 3, we know that BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(C, D), which states that if BRCA2 protein is a human protein, it is involved in HRR. *)
  (* Since we have HumanProtein y, we can infer InvolvedIn y HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn y HRR" sledgehammer
  (* Now, we need to show that InvolvedIn x HRR follows from BRCA2 x and InvolvedIn y HRR. *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x and InvolvedIn y HRR, we can conclude InvolvedIn x HRR. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
