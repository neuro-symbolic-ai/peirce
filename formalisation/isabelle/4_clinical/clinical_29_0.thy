(* Explanation 1: Inhibiting β-catenin may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Inhibiting x ∧ BetaCatenin x ∧ Effective x ∧ Treating y ∧ Patients y ∧ Mutations y ∧ Activating y ∧ In x y"

(* Explanation 2: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway have shown activity in reducing β-catenin levels. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Activity z ∧ Shown x z ∧ Reducing z ∧ BetaCateninLevels z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patients z ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Effective x ∧ Patients z ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z ∧ In x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about drugs, targeting, Wnt pathway, patients, mutations, and activating. *)
  from asm have "Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patients z ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(drugs targeting the Wnt pathway, reducing β-catenin levels). *)
  (* Since we have Drugs x, Targeting x y, and WntPathway y, we can infer reducing β-catenin levels. *)
  then have "Reducing β-catenin levels" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(inhibiting β-catenin, effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations). *)
  (* Reducing β-catenin levels can be considered as inhibiting β-catenin, thus we can infer effectiveness in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
  then have "Effective x ∧ Patients z ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z ∧ In x z" <ATP>
  (* Combine all the information to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
