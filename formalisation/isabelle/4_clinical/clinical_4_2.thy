(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn x y ∧ ChromosomeStability y"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 disrupts chromosome stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Loss x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Disrupt e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ChromosomeStability y"

(* Explanation 3: Disruption in chromosome stability can lead to chromosome breakage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e1 e2. Disruption x ∧ ChromosomeStability y ∧ Lead e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Loss x ∧ BRCA2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage. *)
  shows "∃x y e1 e2. Loss x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the loss of BRCA2. *)
  from asm have "Loss x ∧ BRCA2 y" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(loss of BRCA2, disrupts chromosome stability) *)
  (* C is from explanatory sentence 2, D is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have Loss x and BRCA2 y, so we can infer disruption of chromosome stability. *)
  then have "Disrupt e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ChromosomeStability y" by (simp add: explanation_2)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, F), Implies(disruption in chromosome stability, can lead to chromosome breakage) *)
  (* E is from explanatory sentence 3, F is from explanatory sentence 3. *)
  (* We already have disruption of chromosome stability, so we can infer chromosome breakage. *)
  then have "Lead e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2" by (simp add: explanation_3)
  (* Since disruption leads to chromosome breakage, we can conclude that the loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage. *)
  then have "Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 e2 ∧ ChromosomeBreakage e2" sledgehammer
