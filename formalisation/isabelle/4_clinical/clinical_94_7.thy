(* Explanation 1: MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ∧ Patient y ⟶ UnavailableIn x y"

(* Explanation 2: If MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country, then any treatment involving a MEK inhibitor is unavailable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. (MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ∧ Patient z ∧ UnavailableIn x y) ⟶ (Treatment x ∧ UnavailableFor x z)"

(* Explanation 3: If MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country, then any specific combination treatment involving a MEK inhibitor, such as the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, is unavailable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z w. (MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ∧ Patient z ∧ UnavailableIn x y) ⟶ (Combination w ∧ Vemurafenib w ∧ MEKInhibitor x ∧ UnavailableFor w z)"

(* Explanation 4: If a specific combination treatment involving a MEK inhibitor, such as the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, is unavailable in the patient's country, then it is unavailable for the patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z w. (Combination w ∧ Vemurafenib w ∧ MEKInhibitor x ∧ Country y ∧ Patient z ∧ UnavailableIn w y) ⟶ UnavailableFor w z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor unavailable for patient *)
  shows "∃x y. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y ∧ UnavailableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the assumption, we have known information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib x ∧ MEKInhibitor y" by fastforce
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation: Implies(A, C), which states that if MEK inhibitors are unavailable in the patient's country, then any specific combination treatment involving a MEK inhibitor is unavailable for the patient. *)
  (* Since we have MEKInhibitor y, we can apply this relation to infer that the combination treatment is unavailable for the patient. *)
  then have "UnavailableFor x y" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a combination x and a patient y such that the combination vemurafenib and MEK inhibitor is unavailable for the patient. *)
