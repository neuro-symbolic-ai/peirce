(* Explanation 1: A patient with TNBC has received first-line chemotherapy, and the treatment was administered to manage the disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Disease z ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Administered e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Manage e2"

(* Explanation 2: The best response to the first-line chemotherapy treatment in the patient with TNBC was stable disease, indicating that the treatment was effective in stabilizing the disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Patient z ∧ TNBC z ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Indicating e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Effective y ∧ Stabilizing e1 ∧ Agent e1 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ After e2 e1 ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have a patient with TNBC who has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 provides that the best response to the first-line chemotherapy treatment was stable disease. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, A) to infer that a patient with TNBC has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y z e1. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Patient z ∧ TNBC z ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Indicating e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Effective y ∧ Stabilizing e1 ∧ Agent e1 z" by force
  (* From the derived implications, Implies(C, A) and Implies(C, B), we can infer that the treatment was administered to manage the disease. *)
  then have "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ After e2 e1 ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z" sledgehammer
