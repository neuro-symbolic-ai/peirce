(* Explanation 1: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway may be effective in this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ Effective x z"

(* Explanation 2: Currently no approved drugs in the Wnt pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. ¬(Approved x ∧ Drugs x ∧ InPathway x y ∧ WntPathway y)"

(* Explanation 3: Currently no clinical trials available to paediatric patients looking at drugs in the Wnt pathway. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. ¬(ClinicalTrials x ∧ Available x y ∧ PaediatricPatients y ∧ LookingAt y z ∧ Drugs z ∧ InPathway z w ∧ WntPathway w)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient z"
  (* Hypothesis: Drugs targeting the Wnt pathway are not available for this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ ¬Available x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient z" by auto
  (* Explanation 2 states that there are no approved drugs in the Wnt pathway. *)
  (* This implies that drugs targeting the Wnt pathway are not available for this patient. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∀x y. ¬(Approved x ∧ Drugs x ∧ InPathway x y ∧ WntPathway y)" by blast
  (* Since there are no approved drugs, they cannot be available for the patient. *)
  (* We need to show that there exist drugs targeting the Wnt pathway that are not available for the patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. Drugs x ∧ Targeting x y ∧ WntPathway y ∧ Patient z ∧ ¬Available x z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
