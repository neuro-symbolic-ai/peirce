(* Explanation 1: Homologous recombination repair is the primary process for repairing DNA double strand breaks. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ PrimaryProcess x ∧ Repairing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ DNADoubleStrandBreaks y"

(* Explanation 2: Homologous recombination repair repairs damage to DNA using information copied from a homologous undamaged molecule. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ Damage y ∧ DNA z ∧ Repairs e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ To y z ∧ Information w ∧ Copied e2 ∧ Agent e2 w ∧ From w HomologousUndamagedMolecule"

(* Explanation 3: Undamaged homologous molecules are provided by sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. UndamagedHomologousMolecules x ∧ Provided e ∧ Agent e x ∧ (By x SisterChromatids ∨ By x PaternalMaternalCopies)"

(* Explanation 4: During homologous recombination repair, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ∧ DamagedDNA y ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ Replaced e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ (From z SisterChromatids ∨ From z PaternalMaternalCopies)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HomologousRecombinationRepair x"
  (* Hypothesis: Homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process wherein damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  shows "∀x y z e. HomologousRecombinationRepair x ⟶ DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x ∧ (DamagedDNA y ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ Replaced e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ From z SisterChromatids ∨ From z PaternalMaternalCopies)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about homologous recombination repair. *)
  from asm have "HomologousRecombinationRepair x" by simp
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(A, D), which states that if homologous recombination repair is the primary process for repairing DNA double strand breaks, then during homologous recombination repair, damaged DNA is replaced by undamaged homologous molecules from sister chromatids or paternal/maternal copies of chromosomes. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides A, and Explanation 4 provides D. *)
  (* Since we have HomologousRecombinationRepair x, we can infer the conclusion D. *)
  then have "DamagedDNA y ∧ UndamagedHomologousMolecules z ∧ Replaced e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ (From z SisterChromatids ∨ From z PaternalMaternalCopies)" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that homologous recombination repair is a double strand break DNA repair process. *)
  (* Explanation 1 also implies that homologous recombination repair is a primary process for repairing DNA double strand breaks, which can be interpreted as a double strand break DNA repair process. *)
  then have "DoubleStrandBreakDNARepairProcess x" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
