(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ GenomicInstability y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. GenomicInstability x ∧ Cancer y ⟶ HallmarkOf x y"

(* Explanation 3: Increased genomic instability can lead to the development of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. GenomicInstability x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ Lead e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z"
  (* Hypothesis: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  shows "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about LossOfBRCA2, CancerDevelopment, and GenomicInstability. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(loss of BRCA2, increased genomic instability) *)
  (* We already have LossOfBRCA2 x, so we can infer GenomicInstability z. *)
  then have "GenomicInstability z" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(increased genomic instability, development of cancer) *)
  (* We already have GenomicInstability z, so we can infer CancerDevelopment y. *)
  then have "CancerDevelopment y" by (simp add: assms)
  (* We need to show that LossOfBRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  (* This can be represented by the existence of an event e such that Drives e, Agent e x, Patient e y, and Via e z. *)
  then have "∃e. Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
