(* Explanation 1: If a patient has an activating mutation of the p110α subunit of PI3K, then the patient has a PIK3CA mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. (Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ SubunitOf y z ∧ PI3K z) ⟶ (PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y)"

(* Explanation 2: Patient is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x. Patient x ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient likely has activating PIK3CA mutation, is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides that there exists a patient who is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain x where "Patient x ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x" by blast
  (* We need to show that the patient has a PIK3CA mutation and the mutation is associated with the patient. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides that if a patient has an activating mutation of the p110α subunit of PI3K, then the patient has a PIK3CA mutation. *)
  (* However, we do not have direct information about an activating mutation, so we focus on the known HER2 negative and HR positive status. *)
  (* From the derived implications, we have Implies(B, C) and Implies(B, D), which means if a patient has a PIK3CA mutation, they are HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
  (* Since we have HER2Negative x and HRPositive x, we can infer that the patient likely has a PIK3CA mutation. *)
  then have "PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
  (* Combining all the information, we have the patient with the required properties. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
