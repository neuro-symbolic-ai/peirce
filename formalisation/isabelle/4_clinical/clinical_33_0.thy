(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ EffectiveInTreating x y ∧ Has y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides that there exists a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x z where "Patient x ∧ Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ Has x z" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 states that a Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain a b c where "NotchInhibitor a ∧ Patient b ∧ Mutation c ∧ Activating c ∧ In c CTNNB1 ∧ EffectiveInTreating a b ∧ Has b c" by blast
  (* Since we have a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB1, a Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  then have "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
