(* Explanation 1: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"

(* Explanation 2: The best response [of first-line therapy] was stable disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Response x ∧ Therapy y ∧ FirstLine y ⟶ StableDisease x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ After e1 e2"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient, TNBC, treatment, first-line chemotherapy, and the event of receiving it. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y" by meson
  (* Explanation 2 states that the best response of first-line therapy was stable disease. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∀x y. Response x ∧ Therapy y ∧ FirstLine y ⟶ StableDisease x" by blast
  (* We need to show that the patient had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  (* Since the patient received first-line chemotherapy, we can infer the existence of a stable disease response. *)
  then have "∃y. Disease y ∧ Stable y" sledgehammer
  (* We can now construct the hypothesis statement. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
