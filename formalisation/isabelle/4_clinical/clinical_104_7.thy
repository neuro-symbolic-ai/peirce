  HER2_V777L_Mutation :: "entity ⇒ bool"  (* Added missing consts definition *)

(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain should overcome trastuzumab resistance that has been induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ TargetedTo x y ∧ HER2_Kinase_Domain y ∧ Trastuzumab_Resistance z ∧ HER2_Activating_Mutation z ∧ Overcome e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ InducedBy e2 z"

(* Explanation 2: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. HER2_V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 3: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor can directly overcome the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, and this action is a necessary step in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Resistance z ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation z ∧ Overcome e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ NecessaryStep e2 ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Treatment_Resistance e2"

(* Explanation 4: Directly overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation implies overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y e1 e2. Resistance x ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation x ∧ Overcome e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Treatment_Resistance y ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ (Agent e2 x ⟶ Implies e1 e2)"

(* Explanation 5: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor is specifically aimed at overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, which is a critical factor in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Resistance z ∧ HER2_V777L_Mutation z ∧ Aimed e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ CriticalFactor e2 ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Treatment_Resistance e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about targeting, HER V777L mutation, and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, G), which states that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor implies directly overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
  (* We have F from the premise, so we can infer G. *)
  then have "Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* There is another logical relation Implies(G, H), which states that directly overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation implies overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  (* Since we have G, we can infer H. *)
  then have "Overcome e" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
