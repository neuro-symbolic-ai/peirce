(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene y ∧ BRCA2Protein z ∧ Encode e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ⟶ (x = y)"

(* Explanation 2: The BRCA2 protein is a human protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. BRCA2Protein x ∧ HumanProtein y ⟶ (x = y)"

(* Explanation 3: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in HRR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ (x = y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in HRR. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y HRR ⟶ (x = y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have BRCA2 x and HumanProtein y. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that if BRCA2Protein x and HumanProtein y, then x = y. *)
  (* We can use the derived implication Implies(C, E) which states that if The BRCA2 protein is a human protein, then BRCA2 protein is involved in HRR. *)
  (* Since we have HumanProtein y, we can infer InvolvedIn y HRR. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn y HRR" sledgehammer
  (* Now we have BRCA2 x, HumanProtein y, and InvolvedIn y HRR. *)
  (* We need to show that x = y. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that if BRCA2Protein x, TumourSuppressor y, and InvolvedIn y HRR, then x = y. *)
  (* Since we have InvolvedIn y HRR, we can use the derived implication Implies(C, D) which states that if The BRCA2 protein is a human protein, then BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer TumourSuppressor y. *)
  then have "TumourSuppressor y" <ATP>
  (* Now we have BRCA2 x, HumanProtein y, TumourSuppressor y, and InvolvedIn y HRR. *)
  (* By Explanation 3, we can conclude x = y. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
