(* Explanation 1: A patient with TNBC has received first-line chemotherapy, and the treatment was administered to manage the disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Disease z ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Administered e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Manage e2 z"

(* Explanation 2: The best response to the first-line chemotherapy treatment in the patient with TNBC was stable disease, indicating that the treatment was effective in stabilizing the disease. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Patient z ∧ TNBC z ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Indicating x y ∧ Effective y ∧ Stabilizing y x"

(* Explanation 3: The stable disease response was achieved because the treatment was administered specifically to manage the disease, demonstrating the treatment's effectiveness in achieving disease stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Response x ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Disease z ∧ Achieved e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Administered e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Manage e2 z ∧ Demonstrating e1 y ∧ Effectiveness y ∧ Achieving y x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ After e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient, TNBC, disease, treatment, chemotherapy, and first-line treatment. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 provides that the best response to the first-line chemotherapy treatment was stable disease, indicating the treatment's effectiveness in stabilizing the disease. *)
  (* We have logical relation Implies(C, D) and Implies(B, D) *)
  (* From explanation_2, we can infer that the treatment was effective in stabilizing the disease. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y z. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Patient z ∧ TNBC z ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Indicating x y ∧ Effective y ∧ Stabilizing y x" by blast
  (* From the derived implication Implies(D, B), we can infer that the treatment was administered to manage the disease. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Treatment y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Patient z ∧ TNBC z ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Effective y ∧ Stabilizing y x ∧ Manage e2 z" sledgehammer
  (* From explanation_3, we know that the stable disease response was achieved because the treatment was administered specifically to manage the disease. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃x y z e1 e2. Response x ∧ StableDisease x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Disease z ∧ Achieved e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Administered e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Manage e2 z ∧ Demonstrating e1 y ∧ Effectiveness y ∧ Achieving y x" <ATP>
  (* We can conclude that the patient had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ After e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
