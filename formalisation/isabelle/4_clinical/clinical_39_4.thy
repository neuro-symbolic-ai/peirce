(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1. Blocking the activity of CTNNB1 can reduce the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1. Reducing the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1 is necessary for TTK inhibitors to be effective in patients with such mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ CTNNB1 y ∧ TTKInhibitor z ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Block e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Activity e3 ∧ Reduce e4 ∧ Agent e4 z ∧ Effect e4 y ∧ Necessary e4 (EffectiveIn z x)"

(* Explanation 2: If a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 and TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, then reducing the effects of these mutations is necessary for making TTK inhibitors effective in this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3 e4. (Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ CTNNB1 y ∧ TTKInhibitor z ∧ Has e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Block e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Activity e3) ⟶ (Reduce e4 ∧ Agent e4 z ∧ Effect e4 y ∧ Necessary e4 (EffectiveIn z x))"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about TTK Inhibitor and Patient. *)
  from asm have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides a conditional statement that if a patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1 and TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, then reducing the effects of these mutations is necessary for making TTK inhibitors effective in this patient. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that reducing the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1 is necessary for TTK inhibitors to be effective in patients with such mutations. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(And(A, B), Implies(C, D)) to infer that if reducing the effects of activating mutations in CTNNB1 is achieved, then TTK inhibitors are effective in patients with such mutations. *)
  (* Since we have TTKInhibitor x and Patient y, we can infer EffectiveIn x y. *)
  then have "EffectiveIn x y" sledgehammer
