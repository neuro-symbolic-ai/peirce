(* Explanation 1: Fully active PKB/Akt directly mediates cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e. PKB_Akt x ∧ FullyActive x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival w ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y z ∧ Including y w"

(* Explanation 2: Phosphorylation of bound Akt stimulates full activity of Akt, which directly leads to its activation and subsequent mediation of cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w v e1 e2 e3. Phosphorylation x ∧ BoundAkt y ∧ Activity z ∧ Full z ∧ Proliferation w ∧ Survival v ∧ Stimulates e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Leads e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Activation e3 ∧ Mediates e3 ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Including y w ∧ Including y v"

(* Explanation 3: The activation of Akt results in its role in mediating cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Activation e1 ∧ Akt y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival w ∧ Results e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Mediates e2 ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Including y z ∧ Including y w"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x"
  (* Hypothesis: Fully activated Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  shows "∃x y z w e. Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival w ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y z ∧ Including y w"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about Akt and its full activation. *)
  from asm have "Akt x ∧ FullyActivated x" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 states that the activation of Akt results in its role in mediating cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, B), Implies(Akt is activated, cellular functions including proliferation and survival are mediated) *)
  (* Since we have FullyActivated x, we can infer that Akt is activated, which leads to mediation of cellular functions. *)
  then have "CellularFunctions y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival w ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y z ∧ Including y w" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
