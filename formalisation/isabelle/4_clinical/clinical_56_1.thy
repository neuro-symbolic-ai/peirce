(* Explanation 1: There exists a patient with a PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ With x y"

(* Explanation 2: 1592delT mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x. Mutation x ∧ Mutation1592delT x"

(* Explanation 3: PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x. PALB2 x"

(* Explanation 4: 1592delT is a pathogenic mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Mutation1592delT x ⟶ (Mutation x ∧ Pathogenic x)"

(* Explanation 5: If a patient has a PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ ..."

(* Explanation 6: 1592delT mutation, then the patient has a pathogenic mutation in PALB *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y z. (Mutation1592delT x ∧ Patient y ∧ PALB z) ⟶ (Mutation x ∧ Pathogenic x ∧ Has y x ∧ In x z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ With x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathogenic y ∧ PALB2 z ∧ With x y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient and PALB2. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ With x y" by blast
  (* Explanation 6 provides a logical relation Implies(A, C), which states that if a patient has a PALB2 c.1592delT mutation, then the patient has a pathogenic mutation in PALB. *)
  (* We need to establish that the patient has a PALB2 c.1592delT mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 together imply that there exists a patient with a PALB2 c.1592delT mutation. *)
  from explanation_1 and explanation_2 have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation1592delT y ∧ With x y" sledgehammer
  (* Using Explanation 6, we can infer that the patient has a pathogenic mutation in PALB. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathogenic y ∧ PALB2 z ∧ With x y ∧ In y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
