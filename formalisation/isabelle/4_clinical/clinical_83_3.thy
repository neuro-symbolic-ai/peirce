(* Explanation 1: Patient has received vinorelbine and cisplatin as first-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Vinorelbine y ∧ Cisplatin z ∧ Treatment e ∧ FirstLine e ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Agent e z"

(* Explanation 2: Vinorelbine and cisplatin is a chemotherapy treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. (Vinorelbine x ∧ Cisplatin y) ⟶ Chemotherapy x ∧ Chemotherapy y"

(* Explanation 3: Vinorelbine and cisplatin, when used as first-line treatments, are considered first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. (Vinorelbine x ∧ Cisplatin y ∧ UsedAsFirstLine e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y) ⟶ FirstLineChemotherapy x ∧ FirstLineChemotherapy y"

(* Explanation 4: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Treated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"
