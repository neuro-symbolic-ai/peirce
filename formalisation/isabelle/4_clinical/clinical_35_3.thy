(* Explanation 1: Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, which can counteract the proliferation of cells caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e1 e2. NotchInhibitor x ∧ BetaCateninLevel y ∧ Decrease e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Cells z ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Cause e2 z ⟶ Counteract e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 2: There are Notch inhibitors in development that aim to decrease β-catenin levels. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Development y ∧ In x y ∧ BetaCateninLevel z ∧ Aim e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Decrease e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 3: Reducing the level of β-catenin can counteract the proliferation of cells caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1, potentially making Notch inhibitors effective in treating such conditions. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. BetaCateninLevel x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cells y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y ∧ Cause e1 y ∧ Counteract e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ NotchInhibitor z ∧ EffectiveInTreating z y ∧ Make e3 ∧ Agent e3 z ∧ Patient e3 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "NotchInhibitor x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y ⟶ EffectiveInTreating x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about NotchInhibitor and CTNNB1Mutation. *)
  from asm have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y" by auto
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(A, F), which states that if Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, they are effective in treating conditions caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides that Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, which is A. *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides that reducing the level of β-catenin can counteract the proliferation of cells caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1, potentially making Notch inhibitors effective, which is F. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that Notch inhibitors are effective in treating conditions caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  then have "EffectiveInTreating x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
