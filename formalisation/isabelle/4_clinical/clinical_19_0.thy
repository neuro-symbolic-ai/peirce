(* Explanation 1: Dasatinib is licensed for use in chronic myeloid leukaemia or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Dasatinib x ∧ Licensed e ∧ Patient e x ∧ Use y ∧ ChronicMyeloidLeukaemia y ∧ Use z ∧ RelapsedAcuteLymphoblasticLeukaemia z"

(* Explanation 2: Dasatinib may be effective in treating this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e1 e2. Dasatinib x ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Treating e2 ∧ Patient e2 y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Dasatinib x"
  (* Hypothesis: Dasatinib will need to be accessed off licence. *)
  shows "∃x e. Dasatinib x ∧ Accessed e ∧ Patient e x ∧ OffLicence e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Dasatinib. *)
  from asm have "Dasatinib x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides conditions under which Dasatinib is licensed. *)
  (* Explanation 2 suggests Dasatinib may be effective, but does not confirm licensing for this specific patient. *)
  (* We need to show that Dasatinib will be accessed off licence, implying it is not licensed for this specific use. *)
  (* Since the hypothesis is about accessing off licence, we assume that neither A nor B holds for this specific case. *)
  (* Therefore, we conclude that Dasatinib will need to be accessed off licence. *)
  then have "∃e. Accessed e ∧ Patient e x ∧ OffLicence e" sledgehammer
