(* Explanation 1: Patients with V600E mutation could receive treatment with vemurafenib *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ V600EMutation y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ With z y"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Recovery x ∧ MAPKPathway y ∧ Signaling y ∧ Associated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Resistance e ∧ BRAFInhibitors e"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ Recovery y ∧ MAPKPathway z ∧ Signaling z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Overcoming e2 ∧ Resistance e2 ∧ BRAFInhibitors e2"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy, leading to better treatment outcomes *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcoming e1 ∧ Resistance e1 ∧ Than e1 Monotherapy ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ BetterOutcomes e2"

(* Explanation 5: The effectiveness of combination therapies in overcoming resistance often results in better clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y e1 e2. Effectiveness x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ Overcoming e1 ∧ Resistance e1 ∧ Results e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ BetterOutcomes e2 ∧ ComparedTo e2 Monotherapy"

(* Explanation 6: Better clinical outcomes from combination therapies often yield better results than monotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∃x y e. BetterOutcomes x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e y ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e Monotherapy"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, I), which states that if combination therapies are more effective in overcoming resistance, then better results than monotherapy occur. *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides that combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are more effective in overcoming resistance. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that better results than monotherapy occur. *)
  then have "BetterResults e ∧ Than e y" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that the combination yields better results than monotherapy. *)
  (* Explanation 6 states that better clinical outcomes from combination therapies often yield better results than monotherapy. *)
  (* Since we have inferred better results, we can conclude that the combination yields better results than monotherapy. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
