(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, specifically through disrupting polyADP-ribosylation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ AnticancerAgent x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ PolyADPRibosylation w ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ Through e2 w"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ⟶ (Involved x z ∧ Involved y z)"

(* Explanation 3: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly interferes with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitor x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Defect z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Directly e2 ∧ Mechanism e2 z ∧ Target e2 ∧ In z w"

(* Explanation 4: Interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage directly leads to the targeting of tumor-specific defects in DNA repair, as it prevents the repair of DNA damage in tumor cells *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. Interfere e1 ∧ Role x ∧ Recovery y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Directly e1 ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Defect z ∧ In z y ∧ Prevent e3 ∧ Repair e3 ∧ DNA x ∧ TumorCell y"

(* Explanation 5: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly leads to the inhibition of the recovery process from DNA damage, thereby targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. Inhibitor x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Recovery z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Directly e1 ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Inhibition e2 ∧ Process z ∧ Target e3 ∧ Defect w ∧ Through e3 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the inhibitor, defect, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a scenario where [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly interferes with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* Using the derived implication Implies(A, D), we know that disrupting polyADP-ribosylation leads to targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of an event e that targets the defect y through the role of recovery z. *)
  then have "∃e. Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
