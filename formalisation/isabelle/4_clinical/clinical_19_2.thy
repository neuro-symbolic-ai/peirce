(* Explanation 1: Dasatinib is licensed for use in chronic myeloid leukaemia or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Dasatinib x ∧ Licensed e ∧ Patient e x ∧ (Use y ∧ In y z ∧ (ChronicMyeloidLeukaemia z ∨ RelapsedAcuteLymphoblasticLeukaemia z))"

(* Explanation 2: Dasatinib may be effective in treating this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x e1 e2. Dasatinib x ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Treating e2 ∧ Patient e2 thisPatient"

(* Explanation 3: If Dasatinib is used for conditions other than chronic myeloid leukaemia or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, it will need to be accessed off licence. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1 e2. Dasatinib x ∧ Used e1 ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Condition y ∧ OtherThan y z ∧ (ChronicMyeloidLeukaemia z ∨ RelapsedAcuteLymphoblasticLeukaemia z) ⟶ (Accessed e2 ∧ Patient e2 x ∧ OffLicence e2)"

(* Explanation 4: There are conditions for which Dasatinib is not licensed, and if used for such conditions, it must be accessed off licence. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e1 e2. Condition x ∧ Dasatinib y ∧ ¬Licensed e1 ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ For e1 x ∧ (Used e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ For e2 x ⟶ (Accessed e2 ∧ OffLicence e2))"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Dasatinib x"
  (* Hypothesis: Dasatinib will need to be accessed off licence. *)
  shows "∃x e. Dasatinib x ∧ Accessed e ∧ Patient e x ∧ OffLicence e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Dasatinib. *)
  from asm have "Dasatinib x" by auto
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation: Implies(D, E), which states that if Dasatinib is used for conditions other than chronic myeloid leukaemia or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, it needs to be accessed off licence. *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides another logical relation: Implies(F, E), which states that if Dasatinib is used for conditions for which it is not licensed, it needs to be accessed off licence. *)
  (* Since we have no specific information about the conditions, we can assume that Dasatinib is used for conditions other than the licensed ones or for unlicensed conditions. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that Dasatinib needs to be accessed off licence. *)
  then have "∃e. Accessed e ∧ Patient e x ∧ OffLicence e" sledgehammer
