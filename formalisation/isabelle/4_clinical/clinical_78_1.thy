(* Explanation 1: Upon growth factor stimulation, the regulatory subunit (p85) binds to the catalytic subunit (p110), relieving its inhibitory effect. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 w. GrowthFactorStimulation x ∧ RegulatorySubunit y ∧ CatalyticSubunit z ∧ Binds e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Relieves e2 ∧ Effect w ∧ Inhibitory w ∧ On w z ∧ Upon e1 x"

(* Explanation 2: PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a catalytic (p110) and a regulatory (p85) subunit. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. PI3K x ⟶ (Heterodimer x ∧ Consisting x y z ∧ CatalyticSubunit y ∧ RegulatorySubunit z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "RegulatorySubunit z ∧ CatalyticSubunit x ∧ PI3K y"
  (* Hypothesis: Binding of the catalytic subunit (p110) of PI3K by the regulatory subunit (p85) relieves the inhibitory effect on p110. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. CatalyticSubunit x ∧ PI3K y ∧ RegulatorySubunit z ∧ Binding e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ Relieves e ∧ Effect w ∧ Inhibitory w ∧ On w x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the regulatory subunit, catalytic subunit, and PI3K. *)
  from asm have "RegulatorySubunit z ∧ CatalyticSubunit x ∧ PI3K y" by meson
  (* Explanation 2 provides that PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. *)
  (* This matches the known information, confirming the structure of PI3K. *)
  from explanation_2 have "Heterodimer y ∧ Consisting y x z ∧ CatalyticSubunit x ∧ RegulatorySubunit z" using assms by blast
  (* Explanation 1 states that upon growth factor stimulation, the regulatory subunit binds to the catalytic subunit, relieving its inhibitory effect. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(B, C) to infer that the binding relieves the inhibitory effect. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃e1 e2 w. Binds e1 ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Relieves e2 ∧ Effect w ∧ Inhibitory w ∧ On w x" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the binding of the catalytic subunit by the regulatory subunit relieves the inhibitory effect. *)
  then have "∃e. Binding e ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e x ∧ Relieves e ∧ Effect w ∧ Inhibitory w ∧ On w x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
