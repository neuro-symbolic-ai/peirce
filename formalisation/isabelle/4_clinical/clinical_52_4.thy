(* Explanation 1: PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, initiating the synthesis of PAR. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. PARP1 x ∧ Sites y ∧ SS_DNA_Damage z ∧ Detects e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Initiating e3 ∧ Synthesis e3 z"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 synthesis of PAR recruits repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ PAR y ∧ Repair_Proteins z ∧ Recruits e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Sites z"

(* Explanation 3: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage, particularly in SS DNA damage repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. Recruitment x ∧ Repair_Proteins y ∧ PARP1 z ⟶ (Essential x y ∧ RecognitionRepair e y)"

(* Explanation 4: The recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 directly facilitates the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. Recruitment x ∧ Repair_Proteins y ∧ PARP1 z ∧ Facilitates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RecognitionRepair e y ∧ Directly e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  shows "∃x y e. PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RecognitionRepair e y"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have PARP1 x and DNA_Damage y. *)
  from asm have "PARP1 x ∧ DNA_Damage y" by simp
  (* We need to show that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  (* From the logical relations, we have Implies(A, E), which means if PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, then recruitment of repair proteins directly facilitates the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides that PARP1 detects and binds to sites of SS DNA damage, initiating the synthesis of PAR. *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides that the recruitment of repair proteins by PARP1 directly facilitates the recognition and repair of SS DNA damage. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that PARP1 is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage in SS DNA damage repair. *)
  then have "∃e. Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ RecognitionRepair e y" sledgehammer
