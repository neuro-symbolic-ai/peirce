(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanGene x ∧ BRCA2Protein y ⟶ Encodes x y"

(* Explanation 2: BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. BRCA2Protein x ∧ TumourSuppressor x ∧ InvolvedIn x y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair y ⟶ Suppresses x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  shows "∀x y. BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ InvolvedIn y z ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z ⟶ Encodes x y"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have BRCA2 x, HumanProtein y, and HomologousRecombinationRepair z. *)
  from asm have "BRCA2 x ∧ HumanProtein y ∧ HomologousRecombinationRepair z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 states that BRCA2 is a human gene that encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
  (* We need to show that BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that BRCA2 protein is a tumour suppressor involved in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, D) to infer involvement in homologous recombination repair. *)
  (* Since we have HomologousRecombinationRepair z, we can infer InvolvedIn y z. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn y z" sledgehammer
  (* Now, we need to show that BRCA2 encodes the BRCA2 protein. *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we have the relation Implies(A, B). *)
  (* Since we have BRCA2 x, we can infer Encodes x y. *)
  then have "Encodes x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
