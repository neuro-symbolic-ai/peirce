(* Explanation 1: Olaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licensed for use in prostate cancer patients and is a treatment option for any patient with loss of BRCA2 due to its mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Olaparib x ∧ PARP1Inhibitor x ∧ LicensedForUseIn x y ∧ ProstateCancerPatient y ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ Patient z ∧ LossOfBRCA2 z ∧ DueTo x z ∧ MechanismOfAction z"

(* Explanation 2: Rucaparib is a PARP1 inhibitor licensed for use in prostate cancer patients and is a treatment option for any patient with loss of BRCA2 due to its mechanism of action. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Rucaparib x ∧ PARP1Inhibitor x ∧ LicensedForUseIn x y ∧ ProstateCancerPatient y ∧ TreatmentOption x ∧ Patient z ∧ LossOfBRCA2 z ∧ DueTo x z ∧ MechanismOfAction z"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with loss of BRCA2 may benefit from PARP1 inhibition due to synthetic lethality causing cells to rely on a singular mechanism to repair cumulative damage to DNA. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ PARP1Inhibition y ∧ Benefit e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Source e1 y ∧ SyntheticLethality z ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ RelyOn e2 z ∧ SingularMechanism z ∧ Repair e2 ∧ CumulativeDamageToDNA z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: There are two potential treatment options for this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TreatmentOption x ∧ Patient y ∧ Potential x ∧ For x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 provide information about Olaparib and Rucaparib being treatment options for patients with loss of BRCA2. *)
  (* We can use the logical relations Implies(A, B) and Implies(C, D) to infer that both Olaparib and Rucaparib are treatment options. *)
  have "TreatmentOption Olaparib ∧ TreatmentOption Rucaparib" sledgehammer
  (* Since both Olaparib and Rucaparib are treatment options, they are potential treatment options for the patient. *)
  then have "Potential Olaparib ∧ Potential Rucaparib" sledgehammer
  (* We can now conclude that there are two potential treatment options for this patient. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
