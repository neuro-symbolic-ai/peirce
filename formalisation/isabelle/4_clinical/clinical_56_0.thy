(* Explanation 1: Patient with PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ With x y"

(* Explanation 2: DelT1592 mutated Breast Cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Mutation x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Mutated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y"

(* Explanation 3: PALB2 c *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x. PALB2 x"

(* Explanation 4: DelT1592 is a pathogenic mutation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. DelT1592 x ⟶ (Mutation x ∧ Pathogenic x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PALB2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2 *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathogenic y ∧ PALB2 z ∧ In y z ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the assumption, we have PALB2 z. *)
  from asm have "PALB2 z" by simp
  (* Explanation 4 states that DelT1592 is a pathogenic mutation. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that there exists a mutation y that is pathogenic. *)
  from explanation_4 have "∃y. Mutation y ∧ Pathogenic y" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 1 states that there exists a patient with PALB2. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PALB2 y ∧ With x y" <ATP>
  (* We can combine these to show that there exists a patient with a pathogenic mutation in PALB2. *)
  then have "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Pathogenic y ∧ PALB2 z ∧ In y z ∧ With x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
