(* Explanation 1: Patient now has progressive disease *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Disease y ∧ Progressive y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ Now e"

(* Explanation 2: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ After e z"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with progressive disease are considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Disease y ∧ Progressive y ∧ Considered e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ ForTreatment e"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
  shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Considered e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e"
