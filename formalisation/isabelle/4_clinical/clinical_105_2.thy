(* Explanation 1: Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 extracellular domain, which may result in no inhibitory effect on mutations located in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Trastuzumab x ∧ HER2 y ∧ ExtracellularDomain y ∧ Binds e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Result e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ NoInhibitoryEffect z ∧ Mutations z ∧ IntracellularDomain z"

(* Explanation 2: The HER2 V777L mutation is located in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. HER2V777L x ⟶ IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain x"

(* Explanation 3: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to antibody therapy due to its location in the intracellular domain, which is not targeted by trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1. HER2V777L x ∧ AntibodyTherapy y ∧ Resistance z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ IntracellularDomain x ∧ ¬(∃e2. Targeted e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 x)"

(* Explanation 4: The location of the HER2 V777L mutation in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain can lead to resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2V777L x ∧ IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Lead e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Targets e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ ExtracellularDomain y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HER2V777L x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Resistance z"
  (* Hypothesis: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2V777L x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Resistance z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Binds e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ ExtracellularDomain z ∧ IntracellularDomain x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about HER2V777L, Trastuzumab, and Resistance. *)
  from asm have "HER2V777L x ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Resistance z" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides that HER2V777L is located in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. *)
  (* This corresponds to logical proposition C. *)
  from explanation_2 have "HER2V777L x ⟶ IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain x" by simp
  (* Since we have HER2V777L x, we can infer IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain x. *)
  then have "IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain x" using assms by blast
  (* Explanation 4 provides that the location of HER2V777L in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain can lead to resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  (* This corresponds to logical relation Implies(C, F). *)
  from explanation_4 have "HER2V777L x ⟶ Resistance z" using assms by fastforce
  (* Since we have HER2V777L x, we can infer Resistance z. *)
  then have "Resistance z" using assms by auto
  (* Explanation 1 provides that Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 extracellular domain, which may result in no inhibitory effect on mutations located in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
  (* This corresponds to logical proposition A and B. *)
  from explanation_1 have "Trastuzumab y ⟶ ExtracellularDomain z" sledgehammer
  (* Since we have Trastuzumab y, we can infer ExtracellularDomain z. *)
  then have "ExtracellularDomain z" <ATP>
  (* We have all the components to construct the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
