(* Explanation 1: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y z ∧ V600EMutation z"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling was associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Recovery x ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling y ∧ Associated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Resistance y ∧ BRAFInhibitors y"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ Recovery y ∧ MAPKPathwaySignaling z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Overcoming e2 ∧ Resistance z ∧ BRAFInhibitors z"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy, and this increased effectiveness can lead to better treatment outcomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e1 e2. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcoming e1 ∧ Resistance y ∧ Than y z ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Lead e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e2 w ∧ TreatmentOutcomes w"

(* Explanation 5: The effectiveness of combination therapies in overcoming resistance often results in better clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e. Effectiveness x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ Overcoming e ∧ Resistance z ∧ Results e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ ClinicalOutcomes y ∧ ComparedTo y z ∧ Monotherapy z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Than y z ∧ Monotherapy z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by force
  (* Explanation 4 states that combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy, leading to better treatment outcomes. *)
  (* This implies that the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor is more effective, which aligns with logical proposition E. *)
  (* From logical relation Implies(E, F), we know that more effective combination therapies lead to better treatment outcomes. *)
  (* From logical relation Implies(E, G), we know that more effective combination therapies lead to better clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the combination may yield better results than monotherapy. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Than y z ∧ Monotherapy z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
