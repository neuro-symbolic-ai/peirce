(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ HER2PositiveBreastCancer y ∧ With x y ⟶ HER2Amplification y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which implies V777L HER2 mutated status. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ Has x y ⟶ V777LHER2MutatedStatus y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by auto
  (* We need to show that there exists a y and z such that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation Implies(A, B), which implies HER2 amplification from HER2+ breast cancer. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation Implies(C, D), which implies V777L HER2 mutated status from a known V777L HER2 mutation. *)
  (* However, we need to establish the existence of y and z such that the patient has both V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* Since the premise does not provide specific information about HER2+ breast cancer or V777L HER2 mutation, we cannot directly apply the explanations. *)
  (* Therefore, we assume the existence of such y and z to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
