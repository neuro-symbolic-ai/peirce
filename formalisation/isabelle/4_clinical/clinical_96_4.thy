(* Explanation 1: Patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Common y ∧ BRAF_V600E y ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: Vemurafenib is a low-molecular-weight, orally available inhibitor which selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E kinase and inhibits its activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Vemurafenib x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ LowMolecularWeight y ∧ OrallyAvailable y ∧ Binds e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PatientEvent e1 z ∧ ATPBindingSite z ∧ BRAF_V600E z ∧ Selectively e1 ∧ Inhibits e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Activity z"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib and have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ BRAF_V600E y ∧ Candidate e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ For z y ∧ Potential e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Receive e2 ∧ PatientEvent e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Candidates for treatment with vemurafenib have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e1 e2. Candidate e1 ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ For y y ∧ Potential e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Receive e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ PatientEvent e2 y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Treatment y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient could receive treatment with vemurafenib for V600E mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y V600E"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Patient x, Vemurafenib z, and Treatment y. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Treatment y" by meson
  
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient has a common BRAF V600E mutation. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that patients with a BRAF V600E mutation are candidates for treatment with vemurafenib. *)
  (* Explanation 4 states that candidates for treatment with vemurafenib have the potential to receive vemurafenib as a treatment option. *)
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, D), we can infer that a patient with a BRAF V600E mutation has the potential to receive vemurafenib. *)
  from explanation_1 and explanation_3 and explanation_4 have "∃e. Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PatientEvent e y ∧ With y z ∧ For y V600E" sledgehammer
  
  (* Combining the above with the known information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
