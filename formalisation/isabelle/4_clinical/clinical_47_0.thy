(* Explanation 1: Inhibition of PARP results in collapsed replication forks and DSB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Inhibition x ∧ PARP y ∧ Result e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In e Forks ∧ In e DSB"

(* Explanation 2: Loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Loss x ∧ BRCA2 y ∧ CancerDevelopment z ∧ Drive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Via e GenomicInstability"

(* Explanation 3: Proposal: Trapping of PARP1 at sites of DSBs increases NHEJ and increases toxicity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Trapping x ∧ PARP1 y ∧ DSBs z ∧ Increase e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 NHEJ ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 Toxicity"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PARPInhibitors x ∧ DSBs y ∧ SSBreakRepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: PARP inhibitors cause replication‐associated DSBs by preventing SS break repair, relying on defective HRR and error prone NHEJ to repair DNA. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. PARPInhibitors x ∧ DSBs y ∧ SSBreakRepair z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Rely e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ On e3 HRR ∧ On e3 NHEJ ∧ Repair e3 DNA"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have PARPInhibitors x, DSBs y, and SSBreakRepair z. *)
  from asm have "PARPInhibitors x ∧ DSBs y ∧ SSBreakRepair z" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that inhibition of PARP results in DSB. 
     We have a derived implication: Implies(A, C), which means inhibition of PARP implies DSB. 
     Since we have DSBs y, we can infer that there is an inhibition of PARP. *)
  then have "∃e1. Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y" sledgehammer
  
  (* Explanation 3 suggests that trapping of PARP1 at sites of DSBs increases NHEJ and increases toxicity.
     We have a logical relation: Implies(G, H), which means trapping of PARP1 at sites of DSBs implies increased NHEJ.
     Since we have DSBs y, we can infer that there is trapping of PARP1, leading to increased NHEJ. *)
  then have "∃e3. Rely e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ On e3 NHEJ" <ATP>
  
  (* The hypothesis also involves preventing SS break repair and relying on defective HRR.
     Since we have SSBreakRepair z, we can infer that there is prevention of SS break repair. *)
  then have "∃e2. Prevent e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z" <ATP>
  
  (* Finally, we need to show that the process relies on defective HRR to repair DNA. 
     This is part of the hypothesis and can be inferred from the reliance on NHEJ and the context of the problem. *)
  then have "∃e3. Rely e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ On e3 HRR ∧ Repair e3 DNA" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining all the inferred parts, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
