(* Explanation 1: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"

(* Explanation 2: There are no licenced Notch inhibitors available. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "¬(∃x. LicencedNotchInhibitor x ∧ Available x)"

(* Explanation 3: There are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for hepatoblastoma patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "¬(∃x y. NotchInhibitorInClinicalTrial x ∧ HepatoblastomaPatient y ∧ AvailableFor x y)"

(* Explanation 4: There are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for paediatric patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "¬(∃x y. NotchInhibitorInClinicalTrial x ∧ PaediatricPatient y ∧ AvailableFor x y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Treatment x ∧ Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: This treatment is not available for this patient. *)
  shows "∀x y. Treatment x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AvailableFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Treatment and Patient. *)
  from asm have "Treatment x ∧ Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that there are no licenced Notch inhibitors available. *)
  (* Explanation 3 and 4 state that there are no Notch inhibitors in clinical trials available for specific patients. *)
  (* We have logical relations Not(B), Not(C), and Not(D) from the explanations. *)
  (* Since there are no available Notch inhibitors, we can infer that the treatment is not available for the patient. *)
  then have "¬AvailableFor x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
