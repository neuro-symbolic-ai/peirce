(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, specifically through disrupting polyADP-ribosylation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ AnticancerAgents y ∧ Defects z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In z w ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Role e2 x ∧ Recovery e2 w ∧ Disrupt e2 ∧ PolyADPRibosylation w"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved x z ∧ Involved y z ∧ Crucial z e ∧ Recovery e z"

(* Explanation 3: This process is disrupted by [PARP1/2] inhibitors, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Process x ∧ Inhibitors y ∧ Defects z ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Mechanism e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ ThroughRole e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about inhibitors, defects, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation that [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(A, B) and Implies(A, C) from Explanation 1. *)
  (* Since we have Inhibitors x, we can infer that they target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair and interfere with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ ThroughRole e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
