(* Explanation 1: NCT03568656 might be relevant for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ RelevantFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: NCT03568656 is available for patients with advanced solid tumours *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. NCT03568656 x ∧ Patient y ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour y ∧ AvailableFor x y"

(* Explanation 3: Patient has soft tissue sarcoma *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma y ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 4: Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of advanced solid tumour *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. SoftTissueSarcoma x ⟶ AdvancedSolidTumour x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may be eligible for NCT03568656 *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ NCT03568656 y ∧ EligibleFor x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 states that a patient has soft tissue sarcoma. *)
  from explanation_3 obtain y where "Patient x ∧ SoftTissueSarcoma y ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 4 provides a logical relation that soft tissue sarcoma is a type of advanced solid tumour. *)
  from `SoftTissueSarcoma y` and explanation_4 have "AdvancedSolidTumour y" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 2 states that NCT03568656 is available for patients with advanced solid tumours. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain z where "NCT03568656 z ∧ Patient x ∧ AdvancedSolidTumour x ∧ AvailableFor z x" <ATP>
  (* Since the patient has an advanced solid tumour, they may be eligible for NCT03568656. *)
  then have "NCT03568656 z ∧ Patient x ∧ EligibleFor x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
