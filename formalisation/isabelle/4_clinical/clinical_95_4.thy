(* Explanation 1: Patients with V600E mutation could receive treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ V600EMutation y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ With z y"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Recovery x ∧ MAPKPathway y ∧ Signaling y ∧ Associated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Resistance y ∧ BRAFInhibitors y"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ Recovery y ∧ MAPKPathway z ∧ Signaling z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Overcoming e2 ∧ Resistance z ∧ BRAFInhibitors z"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy, leading to better treatment outcomes and yielding better results than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcoming e2 ∧ Resistance y ∧ Monotherapy z ∧ Leading e3 ∧ TreatmentOutcomes w ∧ BetterResults w ∧ Yielding e3 ∧ Patient e3 w"

(* Explanation 5: The effectiveness of combination therapies in overcoming resistance often results in better clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2. Effectiveness x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ Overcoming e1 ∧ Resistance y ∧ Results e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ ClinicalOutcomes z ∧ Better z ∧ Monotherapy y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Monotherapy z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the combination, vemurafenib, and MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by fastforce
  (* Explanation 4 states that combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than monotherapy, leading to better treatment outcomes and yielding better results than monotherapy. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(And(G, E), H), which implies that the combination of therapies is more effective in overcoming resistance. *)
  (* From this, we can infer that the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor is more effective in overcoming resistance. *)
  then have "More effective in overcoming resistance" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 5 states that the effectiveness of combination therapies in overcoming resistance often results in better clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(H, J), which implies that being more effective in overcoming resistance leads to better clinical outcomes. *)
  then have "Better clinical outcomes" sledgehammer
  (* From the derived implications, we have Implies(H, J), which implies that more effective in overcoming resistance leads to better clinical outcomes. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor yields better results than monotherapy. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ BetterResults y ∧ Monotherapy z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
