(* Explanation 1: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Activating y ∧ In y CTNNB1 ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Activity y ∧ Of y CTNNB1 ∧ Block x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient y"
  (* Hypothesis: A TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  shows "∃x y. TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides information about a patient having an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain z where "Mutation z ∧ Activating z ∧ In z CTNNB1 ∧ Has y z" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 provides information about TTK inhibitors blocking the activity of CTNNB1. *)
  from explanation_2 obtain x w where "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Activity w ∧ Of w CTNNB1 ∧ Block x w" <ATP>
  (* We need to show that a TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  (* Since TTK inhibitors block the activity of CTNNB1, and the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1, *)
  (* it is reasonable to infer that a TTK Inhibitor may be effective in this patient. *)
  then have "TTKInhibitor x ∧ Patient y ∧ EffectiveIn x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
