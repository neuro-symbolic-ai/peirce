(* Explanation 1: The best known genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. GeneticAlteration x ∧ Pathway y ⟶ (KnownAlteration x ∧ ActivatingPointMutation x y ∧ At x PI3K)"

(* Explanation 2: In breast cancer, mutations of the PIK3CA gene are highly frequent. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Mutation x ∧ PIK3CAGene y ∧ BreastCancer z ⟶ (FrequentMutation x ∧ Of x y ∧ In x z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x ∧ BreastCancer y"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  shows "∀x y. PIK3Ca x ∧ BreastCancer y ⟶ (KnownMutation x ∧ FrequentMutation x ∧ ActivatingMutation x y)"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have PIK3Ca x and BreastCancer y. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x ∧ BreastCancer y" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 states that in breast cancer, mutations of the PIK3CA gene are highly frequent. *)
  (* Since we have BreastCancer y, we can infer FrequentMutation x from Explanation 2. *)
  then have "FrequentMutation x" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 1 states that genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
  (* Since PIK3Ca is related to PI3K, we can infer KnownMutation x and ActivatingMutation x y. *)
  then have "KnownMutation x ∧ ActivatingMutation x y" <ATP>
  (* Combining the results, we have KnownMutation x, FrequentMutation x, and ActivatingMutation x y. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
