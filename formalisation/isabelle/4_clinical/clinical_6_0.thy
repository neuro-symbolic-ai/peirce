(* Explanation 1: Loss of BRCA2 may cause increased genomic instability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ GenomicInstability y ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: Increased genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. GenomicInstability x ∧ Cancer y ⟶ HallmarkOf x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ GenomicInstability z"
  (* Hypothesis: loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability *)
  shows "∃x y z e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the loss of BRCA2 and genomic instability. *)
  from asm have "LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ GenomicInstability z" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(loss of BRCA2, increased genomic instability) *)
  (* We already have LossOfBRCA2 x, so we can infer GenomicInstability z. *)
  then have "GenomicInstability z" by simp
  (* There is another logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(increased genomic instability, hallmark of cancer) *)
  (* We already have GenomicInstability z, so we can infer HallmarkOf z y for some cancer y. *)
  then have "∃y. Cancer y ∧ HallmarkOf z y" sledgehammer
  (* From the derived implications, we have Implies(A, C), Implies(loss of BRCA2, hallmark of cancer) *)
  (* We can infer that loss of BRCA2 drives cancer development via genomic instability. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. LossOfBRCA2 x ∧ CancerDevelopment y ∧ GenomicInstability z ∧ Drives e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
