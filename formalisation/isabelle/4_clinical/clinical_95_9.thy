(* Explanation 1: Patients with V600E mutation could receive treatment with vemurafenib. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Patients x ∧ V600EMutation y ∧ Treatment z ∧ Vemurafenib z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ With e z"

(* Explanation 2: Rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling is associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. Recovery x ∧ MAPKPathway y ∧ Signaling y ∧ Associated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Resistance e ∧ BRAFInhibitors e"

(* Explanation 3: MEK inhibitors can help prevent the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling, potentially overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. MEKInhibitors x ∧ Recovery y ∧ MAPKPathway z ∧ Signaling z ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Prevent e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Overcoming e2 ∧ Resistance e2 ∧ BRAFInhibitors e2"

(* Explanation 4: Combination therapies, such as vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor, are often more effective in overcoming resistance than vemurafenib monotherapy, and this effectiveness directly leads to better clinical outcomes. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2 c. CombinationTherapies x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Effective e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Overcoming e1 ∧ Resistance e1 ∧ Than e1 y ∧ Leads e2 ∧ Effectiveness e2 ∧ Directly e2 ∧ ClinicalOutcomes c ∧ BetterOutcomes c"

(* Explanation 5: Better clinical outcomes from combination therapies often yield better results than monotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y e. ClinicalOutcomes x ∧ CombinationTherapies y ∧ BetterOutcomes x ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z"
  (* Hypothesis: Combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor may yield better results than vemurafenib monotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z ∧ Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y"
proof -
  (* From the assumption, we have known information about the combination of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor. *)
  from asm have "Combination x ∧ Vemurafenib y ∧ MEKInhibitor z" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, H), Implies(Combination therapies are used, Better results than monotherapy are achieved) *)
  (* F is from explanatory sentence 4, H is from explanatory sentence 5. *)
  (* Since we have Combination x, we can infer Better results than monotherapy are achieved. *)
  then have "Yield e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Results e ∧ BetterResults e ∧ Than e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
