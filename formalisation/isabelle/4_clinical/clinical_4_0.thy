(* Explanation 1: BRCA2 is a human protein involved in chromosome stability. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. BRCA2 x ⟶ (Protein x ∧ Human y ∧ InvolvedIn x y ∧ Stability y ∧ Chromosome y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Loss x ∧ BRCA2 x ∧ Chromosome y"
  (* Hypothesis: loss of BRCA2 causes chromosome breakage *)
  shows "∃x y e. Loss x ∧ BRCA2 x ∧ Chromosome y ∧ Breakage e ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Loss, BRCA2, and Chromosome. *)
  from asm have "Loss x ∧ BRCA2 x ∧ Chromosome y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(BRCA2 is a human protein, BRCA2 is involved in chromosome stability) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have BRCA2 x, so we can infer that BRCA2 is involved in chromosome stability. *)
  then have "InvolvedIn x y ∧ Stability y ∧ Chromosome y" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Loss of BRCA2 implies a disruption in chromosome stability, leading to breakage. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the existence of a breakage event e with y as the patient. *)
  then have "Breakage e ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
