(* Explanation 1: Patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Received e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient y"

(* Explanation 2: The best response to first-line chemotherapy treatment was stable disease in the patient. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Treatment y ∧ FirstLine y ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Disease z ∧ Stable z ∧ Patient z ⟶ (ResponseTo x y ∧ In z x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC had stable disease after first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient z ∧ After e1 e2"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have a patient with TNBC who has received first-line chemotherapy treatment. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z" by blast
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that a patient has received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that the best response to first-line chemotherapy treatment was stable disease in the patient. *)
  (* We can use these explanations to infer that the patient had a stable disease after the treatment. *)
  
  (* By Explanation 1, we know there exists an event e2 where the patient received first-line chemotherapy. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain e2 where "Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient z" sledgehammer
  
  (* By Explanation 2, we can infer that there exists a response x and a disease y such that the response was stable disease. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y. Response x ∧ Best x ∧ Treatment z ∧ FirstLine z ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Disease y ∧ Stable y ∧ Patient y" <ATP>
  
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the patient had stable disease after the first-line treatment with chemotherapy. *)
  then obtain e1 where "Had e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient y ∧ After e1 e2" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
