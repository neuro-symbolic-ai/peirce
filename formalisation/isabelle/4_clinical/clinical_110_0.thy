(* Explanation 1: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x"

(* Explanation 2: ERBB2 is altered in 13. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. ERBB2 x ∧ Altered e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Location e y ∧ In y z"

(* Explanation 3: 78% of breast carcinoma patients with ERBB2 V777L present in 0. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e. BreastCarcinomaPatient x ∧ ERBB2 y ∧ V777L y ∧ Present e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Location e z ∧ In z w"

(* Explanation 4: 41% of all breast carcinoma patients. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x. BreastCarcinomaPatient x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has a known V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient and the mutation. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y" by auto
  (* Explanation 1 states that a patient has a V777L HER 2 mutation. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that the mutation is known. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x" by blast
  (* Since the mutation is specified in the explanation, it is known. *)
  then have "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Known y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2 y ∧ Has e ∧ Agent e x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
