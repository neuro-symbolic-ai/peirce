(* Explanation 1: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ CheckpointInhibitorAnticancerDrugs x"

(* Explanation 2: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs have started to make progress in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with promising outcomes both in the early and the metastatic setting. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e1 e2. (PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ Progress y ∧ Started e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ TNBC y ∧ Outcomes e2 ∧ Promising e2 ∧ EarlySetting e2 ∧ MetastaticSetting e2"

(* Explanation 3: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x"

(* Explanation 4: As immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e. (PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TNBC y"

(* Explanation 5: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, have shown promising outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by effectively targeting and modulating the immune response. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Shown e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ TNBC y ∧ Targeting e2 ∧ Modulating e3 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Patient e3 z ∧ ImmuneResponse z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC y"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  shows "∃x y e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TNBC y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about immune checkpoint inhibitors, outcomes, promising outcomes, and TNBC. *)
  from asm have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC y" by blast
  (* Explanation 5 states that immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, have shown promising outcomes in TNBC by effectively targeting and modulating the immune response. *)
  (* This implies that there exists an event where immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of such an event. *)
  then have "∃e. Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
