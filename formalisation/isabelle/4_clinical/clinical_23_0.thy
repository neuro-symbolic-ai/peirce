(* Explanation 1: Activating mutations of CTNNB1 promote proliferation of cells via β-catenin. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Mutations x ∧ Activating x ∧ CTNNB1 x ∧ Proliferation y ∧ Cells y ∧ βCatenin z ∧ Promote e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Via e z"

(* Explanation 2: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ βCateninActivity y ∧ Inhibit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Effective x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patients y ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z ∧ CTNNB1 z"
  (* Hypothesis: A YAP inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTTNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patients y ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z ∧ CTNNB1 z ∧ Treat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Effective x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about YAP inhibitor, patients, and activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  from asm have "YAPInhibitor x ∧ Patients y ∧ Mutations z ∧ Activating z ∧ CTNNB1 z" by blast
  (* Explanation 2 states that a YAP inhibitor may be effective in inhibiting β-catenin activity. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, Not(C)), Implies(YAP inhibitor is effective, Not(β-catenin activity)) *)
  (* From explanation 2, we can infer that the YAP inhibitor is effective. *)
  then have "Effective x" sledgehammer
  (* Since the YAP inhibitor is effective, it may treat patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  (* We can construct an event e where the YAP inhibitor treats the patients. *)
  then have "∃e. Treat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
