(* Explanation 1: The patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, and this inappropriateness implies that they are also not appropriate for PARP inhibitors as second-line therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ⟶ (¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ (¬AppropriateFor x y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x z))"

(* Explanation 2: No PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient as second-line therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with TNBC are not appropriate for immunotherapy as second-line therapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Immunotherapy y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y"

(* Explanation 4: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ SecondLine y ∧ ConsideredFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient having TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 provides that patients with TNBC are not appropriate for immunotherapy. *)
  (* This is related to logical proposition D and E, with the relation Implies(D, Not(E)). *)
  then have "¬AppropriateFor x y" if "Immunotherapy y" using explanation_3 that by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides that if a patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, they are also not appropriate for PARP inhibitors as second-line therapy. *)
  (* This is related to logical proposition A and B, with the relation Implies(Not(A), Not(B)). *)
  then have "¬AppropriateFor x z" if "PARPInhibitors z" sledgehammer
  (* Combine the results to show the hypothesis. *)
