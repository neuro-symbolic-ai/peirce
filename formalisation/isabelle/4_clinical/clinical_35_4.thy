(* Explanation 1: Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, which can directly counteract the proliferation of cells caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1, thereby potentially making them effective in treating such conditions. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2 e3. NotchInhibitor x ∧ BetaCatenin y ∧ Cells z ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Decrease e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Counteract e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Cause e2 e3 ∧ Proliferation e3 ∧ EffectiveInTreating x z"

(* Explanation 2: There are Notch inhibitors in development that aim to decrease β-catenin levels, which is a crucial step in counteracting the effects of activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. NotchInhibitor x ∧ Development x ∧ BetaCatenin y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation z ∧ Aim e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Decrease e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ CrucialStep e2 z ∧ Counteract e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y"
  (* Hypothesis: A Notch inhibitor may be effective in treating patients with activating CTNNB1 mutations. *)
  shows "∃x y. (NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y) ⟶ EffectiveInTreating x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the Notch inhibitor, patient, and CTNNB1 mutation. *)
  from asm have "NotchInhibitor x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CTNNB1Mutation y" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation that Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, which can counteract the proliferation of cells caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1, making them effective in treating such conditions. *)
  (* We have the derived implication Implies(A, D), which states that if Notch inhibitors decrease the level of β-catenin, they are effective in treating conditions caused by activating mutations of CTNNB1. *)
  (* Since we have NotchInhibitor x, we can infer EffectiveInTreating x y. *)
  then have "EffectiveInTreating x y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
