(* Explanation 1: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z"

(* Explanation 2: The primary method for systemic management of both early-stage and metastatic settings is chemotherapy, which improves outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. PrimaryMethod x ∧ SystemicManagement y ∧ EarlyStage y ∧ MetastaticSettings y ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ Improves e ∧ Agent e z ∧ PatientEvent e x ∧ Outcomes x ∧ In x TNBC"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y ∧ Treated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Means e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and chemotherapy. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Chemotherapy y" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation that chemotherapy is the primary method for systemic management and improves outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* We have a derived implication Implies(A, C), which means if a patient has breast cancer with no expression of ER, PR, or HER2, it improves outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* Since chemotherapy is involved in improving outcomes, we can infer that the patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  then have "Treated e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Means e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
