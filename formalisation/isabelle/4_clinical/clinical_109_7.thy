(* Explanation 1: Patient with HER2+ breast cancer, which implies HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ HER2PositiveBreastCancer y ∧ HER2Amplification z ∧ With x y ⟶ Implies y z"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has a known V777L HER2 mutation, which directly implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification in the context of breast cancer, and this is associated with the patient having a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ V777LHER2MutatedStatus z ∧ HER2Amplification w ∧ BreastCancer w ∧ Has x y ∧ Implies y z ∧ Implies y w ∧ AssociatedWith y x ∧ SpecificTypeBreastCancer z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ CharacterizedBy z w"

(* Explanation 3: V777L HER2 mutation is associated with a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and implies HER2 amplification in such cases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. V777LHER2Mutation x ∧ SpecificTypeBreastCancer y ∧ HER2Amplification z ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ CharacterizedBy y x ∧ CharacterizedBy y z ∧ Implies x z"

(* Explanation 4: HER2 amplification is a characteristic of certain types of breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. HER2Amplification x ∧ CertainTypesBreastCancer y ⟶ CharacteristicOf x y"

(* Explanation 5: A patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification, and this specific type of breast cancer is associated with the patient having breast cancer *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutation y ∧ SpecificTypeBreastCancer z ∧ HER2Amplification w ∧ With x y ∧ Has x z ∧ CharacterizedBy z y ∧ CharacterizedBy z w ∧ AssociatedWith z x ∧ BreastCancer x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ Has x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by auto
  (* Explanation 2 provides that a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation implies V777L HER2 mutated status and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, D) and Implies(C, B) from Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 5 provides that a patient with a V777L HER2 mutation has a specific type of breast cancer characterized by both V777L HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification. *)
  (* We can use the logical relation Implies(C, E) and Implies(E, F) from Explanation 5. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  then have "∃y z. V777LHER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified z ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ BreastCancer z ∧ Has x y ∧ Has x z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
