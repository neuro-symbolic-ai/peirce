(* Explanation 1: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2, which is classified as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2 ∧ ClassifiedAs y TNBC"

(* Explanation 2: The primary method for systemic management of both early-stage and metastatic settings is chemotherapy, which improves outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y e. PrimaryMethod x ∧ SystemicManagement y ∧ EarlyStage y ∧ MetastaticSettings y ∧ Chemotherapy x ∧ Improves e ∧ PatientEvent e Outcomes ∧ In e TNBC"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with TNBC should be treated with chemotherapy as it is the most effective treatment option available. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x e. Patients x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Treated e ∧ PatientEvent e x ∧ With e Chemotherapy ∧ EffectiveTreatmentOption Chemotherapy"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Treated e ∧ PatientEvent e x ∧ With e Chemotherapy"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information that x is a Patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 1 provides that if a patient has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2, it is classified as TNBC. *)
  (* Explanation 3 states that patients with TNBC should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  (* We have a logical relation Implies(B, E), which means if a patient has TNBC, they should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer that if a patient has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2, they have TNBC. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃y. BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ NoExpression y ER ∧ NoExpression y PR ∧ NoExpression y HER2 ∧ ClassifiedAs y TNBC" <ATP>
  then have "TNBC x" <ATP>
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(B, E), we can infer that patients with TNBC should be treated with chemotherapy. *)
  from `TNBC x` and explanation_3 have "∃e. Treated e ∧ PatientEvent e x ∧ With e Chemotherapy" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
