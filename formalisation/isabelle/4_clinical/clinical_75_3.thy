(* Explanation 1: The best known genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. GeneticAlteration x ∧ Pathway y ∧ Known x ∧ Of x y ⟶ ActivatingPointMutation x ∧ At x PI3K"

(* Explanation 2: In breast cancer, mutations of the PIK3CA gene, specifically PIK3Ca, are highly frequent and are known activating mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Mutation x ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ Of x y ∧ In x BreastCancer ⟶ (Frequent x ∧ KnownActivatingMutation x ∧ Specific x PIK3Ca)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Specific x PIK3Ca"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  shows "∀x. Specific x PIK3Ca ⟶ (KnownActivatingMutation x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Specific x PIK3Ca. *)
  from asm have "Specific x PIK3Ca" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides a logical relation: Implies(D, E) and Implies(E, F). *)
  (* Since we have Specific x PIK3Ca, we can use explanation_2 to infer KnownActivatingMutation x and Frequent x. *)
  (* Explanation 2 also implies that if Specific x PIK3Ca, then In x BreastCancer. *)
  then have "KnownActivatingMutation x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
