(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, specifically through disrupting polyADP-ribosylation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ AnticancerAgents y ∧ Defects z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ ClassOf x y ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In z w ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ RoleOf e2 w ∧ Through e2 w ∧ Disrupt e2"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved x z ∧ Involved y z ∧ Crucial z"

(* Explanation 3: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly interferes with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Defects z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ RoleOf e2 w ∧ Mechanism e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage directly leads to the targeting of tumor-specific defects in DNA repair, as it prevents the repair of DNA damage in tumor cells *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e1 e2. RoleOf e1 x ∧ DNARepair y ∧ Defects z ∧ TumorCells w ∧ Interfere e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Leads e1 e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Prevents e2 ∧ Repair e2 ∧ In w z"

(* Explanation 5: Disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors directly leads to the inhibition of the recovery process from DNA damage, thereby targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Inhibitors x ∧ PolyADPRibosylation y ∧ Defects z ∧ DNARepair w ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Leads e1 e2 ∧ Inhibition e2 ∧ RecoveryProcess e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Through e2 w"

(* Explanation 6: The role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage is essential for targeting tumor-specific defects, as it involves the repair mechanisms that are disrupted by [PARP1/2] inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∃x y z e1 e2. RoleOf e1 x ∧ DNARepair y ∧ Defects z ∧ Essential x ∧ Target e1 ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Involves e2 ∧ RepairMechanisms e2 ∧ Disrupted e2 ∧ Agent e2 x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about inhibitors, defects, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitors x ∧ Defects y ∧ DNARepair z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation that [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  (* This is consistent with the logical relation Implies(A, D), where A is [PARP1/2] inhibitors disrupt polyADP-ribosylation and D is targeting tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* Explanation 3 also supports this by stating that disrupting polyADP-ribosylation by [PARP1/2] inhibitors is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the inhibitors target the defects through the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage. *)
  then have "Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ Through e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
