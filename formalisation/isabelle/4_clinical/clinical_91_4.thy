(* Explanation 1: [PARP1/2] inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage, specifically through disrupting polyADP-ribosylation *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e1 e2 e3. Inhibitor x ∧ AnticancerAgent x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ PolyADPRibosylation w ∧ Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ In y z ∧ Interfere e2 ∧ Role e2 x ∧ Recovery e2 z ∧ Disrupt e3 ∧ Through e3 w"

(* Explanation 2: PARP1 and PARP2 are both involved in polyADP-ribosylation, a process crucial for recovery from DNA damage *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. PARP1 x ∧ PARP2 y ∧ PolyADPRibosylation z ∧ Involved e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Process z ∧ Crucial z ∧ Recovery e z"

(* Explanation 3: This process is disrupted by [PARP1/2] inhibitors, which is a mechanism to target tumor-specific defects *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Process x ∧ Inhibitor y ∧ Defect z ∧ Disrupt e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ Mechanism e2 ∧ Target e2 ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 4: Interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage is a mechanism by which [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Interfere e1 ∧ Role e1 x ∧ Recovery e1 y ∧ DNARepair y ∧ Mechanism e2 ∧ Inhibitor z ∧ Defect w ∧ Target e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ In w y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z"
  (* Hypothesis: [PARP1/2] inhibitors target tumour-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2 in recover from DNA damage *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z ∧ Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ ThroughRole e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the inhibitor, defect, and DNA repair. *)
  from asm have "Inhibitor x ∧ Defect y ∧ DNARepair z" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 provides a scenario where inhibitors target defects in DNA repair by interfering with the role of PARP1/2. *)
  (* Explanation 4 states that interfering with the role of PARP1/2 in recovery from DNA damage is a mechanism by which inhibitors target defects. *)
  (* We have logical relations: Implies(E, A) and Implies(D, E). *)
  (* From these, we can derive that disrupting polyADP-ribosylation (D) leads to targeting tumor-specific defects (A). *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the inhibitors target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair through the role of PARP1/2. *)
  then have "∃e. Target e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z ∧ ThroughRole e z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
