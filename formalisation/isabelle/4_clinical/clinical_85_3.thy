(* Explanation 1: A patient with Triple Negative Breast Cancer has breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ ¬(∃z. Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ Has y z)"

(* Explanation 2: Triple Negative Breast Cancer is defined by the lack of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. TripleNegativeBreastCancer x ∧ Expression y ∧ ER y ∧ PR y ∧ HER2 y ⟶ ¬Has x y"

(* Explanation 3: If a patient has Triple Negative Breast Cancer, then their breast cancer has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 receptors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. (Patient x ∧ TripleNegativeBreastCancer y ∧ Has x y) ⟶ (BreastCancer y ∧ ¬(∃z. Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ Has y z))"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient has breast cancer that has no expression of ER, PR or HER 2. *)
  shows "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y ∧ Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ ¬Has y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient and breast cancer. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Has x y" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 states that if a patient has Triple Negative Breast Cancer, then their breast cancer has no expression of ER, PR, or HER2 receptors. *)
  (* We need to show that the patient has breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, B), we know that if a patient has Triple Negative Breast Cancer, it is equivalent to having breast cancer characterized by the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
  (* Since we have Patient x and BreastCancer y, we can infer the absence of expression of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. *)
  then have "∃z. Expression z ∧ ER z ∧ PR z ∧ HER2 z ∧ ¬Has y z" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
