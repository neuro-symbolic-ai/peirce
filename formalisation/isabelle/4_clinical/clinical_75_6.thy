(* Explanation 1: The best known genetic alterations of this pathway are activating point mutations at PI3K. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. GeneticAlteration x ∧ BestKnown x ∧ OfPathway x ⟶ ActivatingPointMutationAt x PI3K"

(* Explanation 2: In breast cancer, mutations of the PIK3CA gene, specifically PIK3Ca, are highly frequent and are known activating mutations. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. MutationOf x PIK3CA ∧ SpecificTo x y ∧ PIK3Ca y ∧ In x BreastCancer ⟶ (Frequent x ∧ KnownActivatingMutation x)"

(* Explanation 3: If a mutation is specific to PIK3Ca, then it is a known and frequent activating mutation present in breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. SpecificTo x y ∧ PIK3Ca y ⟶ (KnownActivatingMutation x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PIK3Ca x"
  (* Hypothesis: PIK3Ca is a known and frequent activating mutation in breast cancer. *)
  shows "∀x. PIK3Ca x ⟶ (KnownActivatingMutation x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer)"
proof -
  (* From the assumption, we have PIK3Ca x. *)
  from asm have "PIK3Ca x" by simp
  (* Explanation 3 states that if a mutation is specific to PIK3Ca, then it is a known and frequent activating mutation present in breast cancer. *)
  (* This can be represented as Implies(D, And(E, F)), where D is specific to PIK3Ca, E is known activating mutations, and F is frequent activating mutation present in breast cancer. *)
  (* Since we have PIK3Ca x, we can apply explanation_3 to infer KnownActivatingMutation x, Frequent x, and In x BreastCancer. *)
  then have "KnownActivatingMutation x ∧ Frequent x ∧ In x BreastCancer" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
