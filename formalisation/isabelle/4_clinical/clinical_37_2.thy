(* Explanation 1: CFI-402257 may be suitable for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. CFI402257 x ∧ Patient y ∧ SuitableFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: CFI-402257 study is only in Canada *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CFI402257Study x ⟶ InCanada x"

(* Explanation 3: The patient is not currently in Canada, and if they are not in Canada, they will have to travel for treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x e1 e2. Patient x ∧ ¬InCanada x ∧ (¬InCanada x ⟶ (Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ ForTreatment e1)) ∧ Travel e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ ForTreatment e2"

(* Explanation 4: If the patient has to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for them *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x e. Patient x ∧ (Travel e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e ⟶ ¬Suitable x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient will have to travel, may not be suitable *)
  shows "∃x e. Patient x ∧ Travel e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ¬Suitable x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 provides that if the patient is not in Canada, they will have to travel for treatment. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(C), D), Implies(Not(the patient is currently in Canada), the patient will have to travel for treatment) *)
  (* From explanation_3, we have ¬InCanada x ⟶ (Travel e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ ForTreatment e1) *)
  (* Since the patient is not in Canada, we can infer that the patient will have to travel for treatment. *)
  from explanation_3 have "¬InCanada x ⟶ (Travel e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e)" sledgehammer
  then have "Travel e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 4 provides that if the patient has to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for them. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(the patient will have to travel for treatment, it may not be suitable for the patient) *)
  (* From explanation_4, we have (Travel e ∧ Agent e x ∧ ForTreatment e ⟶ ¬Suitable x) *)
  then have "¬Suitable x" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
