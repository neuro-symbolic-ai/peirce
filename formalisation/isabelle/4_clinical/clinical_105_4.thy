(* Explanation 1: Trastuzumab binds specifically to the HER2 extracellular domain, and this binding does not affect mutations located in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Trastuzumab x ∧ HER2 y ∧ ExtracellularDomain y ∧ Bind e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Specifically e1 ∧ Mutation z ∧ IntracellularDomain z ∧ Affect e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ ¬Affect e2"

(* Explanation 2: The HER2 V777L mutation is located in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which is not targeted by trastuzumab. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. HER2V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain y ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ ¬TargetedBy x z"

(* Explanation 3: The HER2 V777L mutation may cause resistance to antibody therapy because it is located in the intracellular domain, which trastuzumab does not target. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1. HER2V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ Resistance y ∧ AntibodyTherapy z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ To y z ∧ IntracellularDomain x ∧ LocatedIn x x ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ ¬TargetedBy x z"

(* Explanation 4: The location of the HER2 V777L mutation in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain can lead to resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain and does not affect the intracellular domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain y ∧ Location x y ∧ Resistance z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Lead e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ ExtracellularDomain y ∧ Target z ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ IntracellularDomain y ∧ ¬Affect e2"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HER2V777L x ∧ Trastuzumab z"
  (* Hypothesis: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
  shows "∃x y z e1 e2. HER2V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ To y z ∧ Bind e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 x ∧ ExtracellularDomain x ∧ IntracellularDomain x"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have HER2V777L x and Trastuzumab z. *)
  from asm have "HER2V777L x ∧ Trastuzumab z" by blast
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(C, E), we know that if the HER2 V777L mutation is located in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, it may cause resistance to antibody therapy. *)
  (* Explanation 2 provides that the HER2 V777L mutation is located in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. *)
  from explanation_2 have "HER2V777L x ∧ Mutation x ∧ IntracellularTyrosineKinaseDomain y ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ ¬TargetedBy x z" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the HER2 V777L mutation may cause resistance to antibody therapy. *)
  then have "Resistance y" <ATP>
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(F, E), we know that if trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain and does not affect the intracellular domain, the HER2 V777L mutation may cause resistance to antibody therapy. *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides that trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain and does not affect the intracellular domain. *)
  from explanation_4 have "Trastuzumab z ∧ ExtracellularDomain y ∧ IntracellularDomain y ∧ ¬Affect e2" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the HER2 V777L mutation may cause resistance to trastuzumab. *)
  then have "Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ To y z" <ATP>
  (* We also know from explanation 1 that trastuzumab binds specifically to the HER2 extracellular domain. *)
  from explanation_1 have "Bind e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 x ∧ Specifically e2" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
