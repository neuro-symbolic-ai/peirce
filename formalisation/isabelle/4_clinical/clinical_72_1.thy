(* Explanation 1: PI3Ks are a family of lipids comprised of a catalytic subunit, which includes p110, and a regulatory subunit. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z w. PI3Ks x ∧ Family x ∧ Lipids y ∧ CatalyticSubunit z ∧ Includes z w ∧ p110 w ∧ RegulatorySubunit z"

(* Explanation 2: There are three different isoforms of the p110 subunit in mammals, and p110α is one of these isoforms. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Isoform x ∧ Different x ∧ Three x ∧ Subunit y ∧ p110 y ∧ Mammals y ∧ p110α z ∧ Isoform z ∧ OneOf z x"

(* Explanation 3: p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene, and this transcription involves a specific event where p110α acts as the agent and PIK3CA gene as the source. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. p110α x ∧ PIK3CA y ∧ Transcribed e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Source e1 y ∧ Transcription z ∧ Involves z e2 ∧ Event e2 ∧ Acts e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Source e2 y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "p110α y ∧ PIK3CA z"
  (* Hypothesis: PI3Ks catalytic subunit p110, of which p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Subunit x ∧ Catalytic x ∧ PI3Ks x ∧ p110 x ∧ p110α y ∧ Transcribed e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Source e z ∧ PIK3CA z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about p110α and PIK3CA. *)
  from asm have "p110α y ∧ PIK3CA z" by auto
  (* Explanation 3 provides that p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene, and this transcription involves a specific event. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, F), Implies(p110α is transcribed from the PIK3CA gene, transcription involves a specific event where p110α acts as the agent and PIK3CA gene as the source) *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of a transcription event involving p110α and PIK3CA. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∃e. Transcribed e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Source e z" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 1 provides that PI3Ks are a family of lipids comprised of a catalytic subunit, which includes p110. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(PI3Ks are a family of lipids comprised of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, p110 is part of the catalytic subunit) *)
  (* We can use this to infer the existence of a catalytic subunit that includes p110. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x. Subunit x ∧ CatalyticSubunit x ∧ PI3Ks x ∧ p110 x" <ATP>
  (* Combining these inferences, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
