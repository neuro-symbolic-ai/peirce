(* Explanation 1: Patient likely has an activating mutation of the p110α subunit of PI3K, which is a PIK3CA mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ Subunit z ∧ P110Alpha z ∧ PI3K z ∧ Of y z ∧ Has x y ∧ PIK3CAMutation y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x. Patient x ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient likely has activating PIK3CA mutation, is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient likely has an activating mutation of the p110α subunit of PI3K, which is a PIK3CA mutation. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that there exists a mutation y such that the patient has a PIK3CA mutation. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain y z where "Mutation y ∧ Subunit z ∧ P110Alpha z ∧ PI3K z ∧ Of y z ∧ Has x y ∧ PIK3CAMutation y" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 provides that the patient is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
  from explanation_2 have "HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x" <ATP>
  (* Combining these, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then have "PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
