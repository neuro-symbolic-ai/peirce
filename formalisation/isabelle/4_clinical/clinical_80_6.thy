(* Explanation 1: The patient is not appropriate for immunotherapy, and this inappropriateness implies that they are also not appropriate for PARP inhibitors as second-line therapy if they have TNBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Immunotherapy y ∧ PARPInhibitors z ⟶ (¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ (¬AppropriateFor x z ⟶ TNBC x))"

(* Explanation 2: No PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient as second-line therapy if the patient has TNBC *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ PARPInhibitors y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor y x"

(* Explanation 3: Patients with TNBC are not appropriate for immunotherapy as second-line therapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ Immunotherapy y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y"

(* Explanation 4: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment if they are appropriate for either immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ (AppropriateFor x y ∨ AppropriateFor x z ⟶ ConsideredFor x SecondLineTreatment)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient having TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* Using explanation_3, we know that patients with TNBC are not appropriate for immunotherapy as second-line therapy. *)
  then have "∀y. Immunotherapy y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y" using explanation_3 by blast
  (* Using explanation_2, we know that no PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient as second-line therapy if the patient has TNBC. *)
  then have "∀z. PARPInhibitors z ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x z" sledgehammer
  (* Combining both results, we can conclude that the patient with TNBC is not appropriate for either immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second-line therapy. *)
  then show "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
