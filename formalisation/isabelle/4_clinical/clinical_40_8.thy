(* Explanation 1: Patient has hepatoblastoma with a mutation CTNNB1 W25_H36del. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Mutation z ∧ Has x y ∧ With y z ∧ CTNNB1W25_H36del z"

(* Explanation 2: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. CTNNB1W25_H36del x ⟶ ActivatingMutation x"

(* Explanation 3: CTNNB1 W25_H36del is within the CTNNB1 gene. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. CTNNB1W25_H36del x ⟶ Within x CTNNB1"

(* Explanation 4: If a patient with hepatoblastoma has a mutation, and that mutation is CTNNB1 W25_H36del, then the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. (Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Mutation z ∧ Has x z ∧ CTNNB1W25_H36del z) ⟶ (ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: This patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ ActivatingMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ In y CTNNB1"
proof -
  (* From Explanation 1, we know there exists a patient with hepatoblastoma and a mutation CTNNB1 W25_H36del. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain x y z where "Patient x ∧ Hepatoblastoma y ∧ Mutation z ∧ Has x y ∧ With y z ∧ CTNNB1W25_H36del z" by blast
  (* From Explanation 2, we know that CTNNB1 W25_H36del is an activating mutation. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation z" using explanation_2 by blast
  (* From Explanation 4, if a patient with hepatoblastoma has a mutation, and that mutation is CTNNB1 W25_H36del, then the patient has an activating mutation in CTNNB. *)
  then have "ActivatingMutation z ∧ In z CTNNB1" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a patient with an activating mutation in CTNNB1. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
