(* Explanation 1: Fully active PKB/Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including angiogenesis, metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, transcription, and apoptosis. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e a m g p s ps t ap. Akt x ∧ Active x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y a ∧ Angiogenesis a ∧ Including y m ∧ Metabolism m ∧ Including y g ∧ Growth g ∧ Including y p ∧ Proliferation p ∧ Including y s ∧ Survival s ∧ Including y ps ∧ ProteinSynthesis ps ∧ Including y t ∧ Transcription t ∧ Including y ap ∧ Apoptosis ap"

(* Explanation 2: Phosphorylation of bound Akt stimulates full activity of Akt, leading to its role in mediating cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2 w p s. Phosphorylation x ∧ Akt y ∧ Bound y ∧ Activity z ∧ Akt z ∧ Stimulates e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Mediates e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ CellularFunctions w ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ Including w p ∧ Proliferation p ∧ Including w s ∧ Survival s"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Akt x ∧ Active x"
  (* Hypothesis: Fully activated Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  shows "∃x y e p s. Akt x ∧ Active x ∧ CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y p ∧ Proliferation p ∧ Including y s ∧ Survival s"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Akt being active. *)
  from asm have "Akt x ∧ Active x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides that fully active PKB/Akt mediates numerous cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  (* This corresponds to logical proposition A and B, where A: PKB/Akt is fully active and B: mediates cellular functions including proliferation and survival. *)
  (* We have Akt x ∧ Active x, which implies A. *)
  (* From the logical relation Implies(A, B), we can infer B. *)
  then have "∃y e p s. CellularFunctions y ∧ Mediates e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Including y p ∧ Proliferation p ∧ Including y s ∧ Survival s" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
