(* Explanation 1: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitor anticancer drugs. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ CheckpointInhibitorAnticancerDrugs x"

(* Explanation 2: Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs have started to make progress in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with promising outcomes both in the early and the metastatic setting. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w u v e1 e2. (PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ Progress y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Outcomes w ∧ Promising w ∧ EarlySetting u ∧ MetastaticSetting v ∧ Started e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Make e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ In y z ∧ With y w ∧ In w u ∧ In w v"

(* Explanation 3: PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (PD1Inhibitors x ∨ PDL1Inhibitors x) ⟶ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x"

(* Explanation 4: As immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z e. (PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ TNBC z"
  (* Hypothesis: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  shows "∃x y e. ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about immune checkpoint inhibitors and TNBC. *)
  from asm have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ TNBC z" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), which states that PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors as immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  (* Explanation 4 provides the existence of such outcomes and their promising nature in TNBC. *)
  from explanation_4 obtain y e where "(PD1Drugs x ∨ PDL1Drugs x) ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Shown e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z" sledgehammer
  (* We can infer that immune checkpoint inhibitors have had promising outcomes in TNBC. *)
  then have "ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors x ∧ Outcomes y ∧ Promising y ∧ TNBC z ∧ Had e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
