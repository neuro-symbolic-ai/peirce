(* Explanation 1: Using a kinase inhibitor may target mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit proliferation and survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. KinaseInhibitor x ∧ Mutations y ∧ PI3KAKTPathway y ∧ Proliferation z ∧ Survival z ∧ (Target e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y) ∧ (Inhibit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z)"

(* Explanation 2: Treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Treatment x ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant x ∧ ProgressionFreeSurvival y ∧ Patients z ∧ PIK3CAMutated z ∧ HRPositive z ∧ HER2Negative z ∧ AdvancedBreastCancer z ∧ (Prolonged e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Among e1 z) ∧ (EndocrineTherapy w ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ Previously e2)"

(* Explanation 3: Patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PatientEntity x ∧ Chemotherapy y ⟶ LessSensitiveTo x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "PatientEntity x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Previously e1"
  (* Hypothesis: If patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they may benefit from treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant to target PIK3CA mutation. *)
  shows "∀x y z e1 e2. (PatientEntity x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Previously e1) ⟶ (Benefit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ From e2 z ∧ Target e2 ∧ PIK3CAMutation z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the patient having previously received endocrine therapy. *)
  from asm have "PatientEntity x ∧ EndocrineTherapy y ∧ Received e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Previously e1" by meson
  
  (* Explanation 2 provides a scenario where treatment with alpelisib–fulvestrant is beneficial for patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that such patients may benefit from the treatment. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∃x y z w e1 e2. Treatment x ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant x ∧ ProgressionFreeSurvival y ∧ Patients z ∧ PIK3CAMutated z ∧ HRPositive z ∧ HER2Negative z ∧ AdvancedBreastCancer z ∧ (Prolonged e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Among e1 z) ∧ (EndocrineTherapy w ∧ Received e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ Previously e2)" sledgehammer
  
  (* Since the patient has previously received endocrine therapy, they fit the criteria for benefiting from alpelisib-fulvestrant treatment. *)
  then have "Benefit e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Treatment z ∧ AlpelisibFulvestrant z ∧ From e2 z ∧ Target e2 ∧ PIK3CAMutation z" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
