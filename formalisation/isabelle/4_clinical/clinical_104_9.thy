(* Explanation 1: An irreversible inhibitor that is targeted to the HER2 kinase domain should overcome trastuzumab resistance that has been induced by a HER2-activating mutation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Targeted x y ∧ HER2_Kinase_Domain y ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Trastuzumab_Resistance z ∧ Induced z HER2_Activating_Mutation"

(* Explanation 2: HER2 V777L may cause resistance to trastuzumab, as trastuzumab binds to the extracellular kinase domain, whereas the mutation is in the intracellular kinase domain. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. HER2_V777L x ∧ Resistance y ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Cause e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Bind z Extracellular_Kinase_Domain ∧ Mutation_In Intracellular_Kinase_Domain"

(* Explanation 3: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor can directly overcome the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, and this action is a necessary step in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Overcome e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Resistance z ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Necessary_Step e1 z"

(* Explanation 4: Directly overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation is a critical factor in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y e1 e2. Overcome e1 ∧ Resistance x ∧ Cause e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Patient e2 x ∧ Critical_Factor e1 x"

(* Explanation 5: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor is specifically aimed at overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, which is a critical factor in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∃x y z e1 e2. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Aim e1 ∧ Overcome e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Resistance z ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Critical_Factor e2 z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"
  (* Hypothesis: Targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor may overcome treatment resistance. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about HER_V777L_Mutation and Treatment_Resistance. *)
  from asm have "HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 provides a logical relation: targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor can directly overcome the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation. *)
  (* This action is a necessary step in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(F, G) and Implies(G, H), which implies Implies(F, H). *)
  (* Explanation 5 states that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor is specifically aimed at overcoming the resistance caused by the HER2 V777L mutation, which is a critical factor in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(F, I). *)
  (* From these, we can infer that targeting the HER V777L mutation with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor is a necessary step and a critical factor in overcoming treatment resistance. *)
  then have "∃x e. Targeting x ∧ HER_V777L_Mutation y ∧ Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor x ∧ Irreversible x ∧ Overcome e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Treatment_Resistance y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
