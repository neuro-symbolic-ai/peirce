(* Explanation 1: Patient to be considered for second-line treatment *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Patient x ∧ SecondLineTreatment y ⟶ ConsideredFor x y"

(* Explanation 2: It is unknown whether the patient will be appropriate for immune checkpoint inhibitors, but they are not considered appropriate for immunotherapy *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ ImmuneCheckpointInhibitors y ∧ Immunotherapy z ⟶ (Unknown (AppropriateFor x y) ∧ ¬ConsideredAppropriateFor x z)"

(* Explanation 3: No PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. PARPInhibitors x ∧ Patient y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ TNBC x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient with TNBC not appropriate for immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors as second line therapy *)
  shows "∀x y z. Patient x ∧ TNBC x ∧ (Immunotherapy y ∨ PARPInhibitors z) ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y ∧ ¬AppropriateFor x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient with TNBC. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ TNBC x" by simp
  (* Explanation 2 provides that the patient is not considered appropriate for immunotherapy. *)
  (* Explanation 3 provides that no PARP inhibitors are appropriate for this patient. *)
  (* We need to show that the patient is not appropriate for either immunotherapy or PARP inhibitors. *)
  have "∀y. Immunotherapy y ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x y" sledgehammer
  have "∀z. PARPInhibitors z ⟶ ¬AppropriateFor x z" <ATP>
  (* Combining these, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
