(* Explanation 1: Patient likely has activating PIK3CA mutation, is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Likely x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"

(* Explanation 2: Patients with HR+/Her2- mBC and PIK3CA mutation were less sensitive to chemotherapy and presented worse overall survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Patients x ∧ HRPositive x ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ mBC x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ Chemotherapy z ∧ LessSensitiveTo x z ∧ Present e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ WorseOverallSurvival e2 ∧ PatientEvent e2 x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient is likely less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  shows "∃x. Patient x ∧ Likely x ∧ LessSensitiveTo x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides that a patient likely has activating PIK3CA mutation, is HER2 negative, and HR positive. *)
  (* This aligns with the logical proposition A, B, and C. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain y where "Likely x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 states that patients with HR+/HER2- mBC and PIK3CA mutation are less sensitive to chemotherapy. *)
  (* This aligns with the logical relation Conjunction(A, B, C) → D and Implies(D, E). *)
  from explanation_2 obtain z where "LessSensitiveTo x z" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Patient x ∧ Likely x ∧ LessSensitiveTo x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
