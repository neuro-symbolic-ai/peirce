(* Explanation 1: With the development of a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, trastuzumab, the prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients has dramatically improved. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1 e2. Prognosis x ∧ Patient y ∧ HER2Positive y ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ Antibody z ∧ Humanized z ∧ Monoclonal z ∧ Target e1 ∧ HER2Receptor e1 ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ Trastuzumab z ∧ Development e2 ∧ Means e2 z ∧ Improved e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Dramatically e2"

(* Explanation 2: Patient has V777L HER 2 mutated and HER 2 amplified breast cancer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Patient x ∧ BreastCancer y ∧ V777L y ∧ HER2Mutated y ∧ HER2Amplified y ∧ Has x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab y"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab y ∧ Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Source e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the patient and treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  from asm have "Patient x ∧ Treatment y ∧ Trastuzumab y" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation Implies(A, B), which implies that the development of a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, trastuzumab, leads to improved prognosis for HER2+ breast cancer patients. *)
  (* Explanation 2 indicates that the patient has V777L HER2 mutated and HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* From the derived implications, we have Implies(A, D), which means the development of trastuzumab implies the patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer. *)
  (* Since the patient has HER2 amplified breast cancer, they may benefit from treatment with Trastuzumab. *)
  then have "Benefit e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Source e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
