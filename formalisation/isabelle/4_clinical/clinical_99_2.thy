(* Explanation 1: Through its regulation of MAPK/ERK, BRAF plays a role in cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z w e. BRAF x ∧ Regulation y ∧ MAPK_ERK z ∧ Through y z ∧ Play e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Role e ∧ In x w ∧ Division e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e"

(* Explanation 2: A BRAF mutation is a spontaneous change in the BRAF gene that causes the gene to turn on the protein and keep it on. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Mutation x ∧ BRAF y ∧ Gene z ∧ Change w ∧ Spontaneous w ∧ In w y ∧ Cause e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ TurnOn e2 ∧ Agent e2 z ∧ Protein w ∧ KeepOn e2 w"

(* Explanation 3: When the BRAF gene is turned on continuously due to a mutation, it disrupts the normal regulation of MAPK/ERK, which directly affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w v e1 e2 e3. BRAF x ∧ Gene y ∧ Mutation z ∧ TurnOn e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Continuously e1 ∧ DueTo e1 z ∧ Disrupt e2 ∧ Agent e2 y ∧ Regulation w ∧ Normal w ∧ MAPK_ERK v ∧ Of w v ∧ Affect e3 ∧ Agent e3 w ∧ Directly e3 ∧ Division e3 ∧ Differentiation e3 ∧ Secretion e3"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Mutation x ∧ BRAF y ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: A mutation in BRAF affects cell division, differentiation and secretion *)
  shows "∃x y e. Mutation x ∧ BRAF y ∧ In x y ∧ Affect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Division e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the mutation in BRAF. *)
  from asm have "Mutation x ∧ BRAF y ∧ In x y" by blast
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(C, F), which states that a BRAF mutation occurs implies a direct effect on cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  (* Since we have Mutation x, we can infer the direct effect on cell division, differentiation, and secretion. *)
  then have "Affect e ∧ Division e ∧ Differentiation e ∧ Secretion e" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show the existence of such an event e that satisfies the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
