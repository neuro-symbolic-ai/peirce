(* Explanation 1: Patient likely has activating mutation of p110α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA). *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Patient x ∧ Mutation y ∧ P110αSubunit y ∧ PI3K y ∧ Has x y"

(* Explanation 2: Patient is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x. Patient x ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Patient x"
  (* Hypothesis: Patient likely has activating PIK3CA mutation, is HER2 negative and HR positive. *)
  shows "∃x y. Patient x ∧ PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about the patient. *)
  from asm have "Patient x" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 provides information about the mutation related to PIK3CA. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain y where "Mutation y ∧ P110αSubunit y ∧ PI3K y ∧ Has x y" sledgehammer
  (* Explanation 2 provides information about HER2 negative and HR positive status. *)
  from explanation_2 have "HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information from explanations 1 and 2, we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  then have "PIK3CAMutation y ∧ Has x y ∧ HER2Negative x ∧ HRPositive x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
