(* Explanation 1: Investigation sometimes requires experimentation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Investigation x ∧ Experimentation y ∧ Requires x y"

(* Explanation 2: Observations; data are a part of the results of an experiment. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Experiment z ⟶ (PartOf x (Results z) ∧ PartOf y (Results z))"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Purpose e z"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Recording e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ Agent e z ∧ Communicates e Investigation"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about Alan, cabbage juice, household solutions, using, agent, and patient. *)
  from asm have "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(investigation requires experimentation, observations and data are part of the results of an experiment) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have Observations x and Data y, so we can infer Observations x, Data y, and Journal z. *)
  then have "Observations x ∧ Data y ∧ Journal z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show the rest of the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
