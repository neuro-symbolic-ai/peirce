(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers; other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Animal x ∧ Role y ∧ Consumer y ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Producer z ∧ OtherAnimal z ∧ Food z"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlant x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals; plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (EnergySource x ∧ Animal x) ∨ Plant x"

(* Explanation 5: Eating; taking in food is used to get nutrients; energy by animals; living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e1 e2. Eat e1 ∧ TakeInFood e1 ∧ Use e2 ∧ Get e2 ∧ Nutrient e2 ∧ Energy e2 ∧ Agent e1 e2 ∧ LivingThing e2"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThing x ∧ Energy y ⟶ Require x y ∧ Survival x"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y z e. Organism x ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ (Food y ⟶ SourceOfFood x e)"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ∧ Means y ⟶ Get y"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. Herbivore x ⟶ Eat x Plant"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Require y e ∧ Survival y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are in a meadow ecosystem, there is a mouse, and there is a plant. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z" <ATP>
  (* Since a mouse is a kind of herbivore, and herbivores only eat plants, we can infer that the mouse eats the plant. *)
  from ‹Mouse y› and ‹Herbivore y› have "Eat y z" <ATP>
  (* According to the explanation that if an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism, the plant is a source of food for the mouse. *)
  from ‹Eat y z› have "Food z ⟶ SourceOfFood y (Eat y z)" <ATP>
  (* Since food is a source of energy for animals and plants, and a mouse is a kind of animal, the plant is a source of energy for the mouse. *)
  from ‹Food z› and ‹Animal y› have "EnergySource z" <ATP>
  (* Living things all require energy for survival, and a mouse is a kind of living thing, so the mouse requires the energy obtained from the plant for survival. *)
  from ‹LivingThing y› and ‹EnergySource z› have "Require y (SourceOfFood y (Eat y z)) ∧ Survival y" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can conclude that in a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
