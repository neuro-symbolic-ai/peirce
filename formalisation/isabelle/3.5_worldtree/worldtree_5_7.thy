(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers or other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Animal x ∧ Role y ∧ Consumer y ∧ Eat e x z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ ((Producer z) ∨ (Animal z ∧ ForFood e))"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlant x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (EnergySource x ∧ (Animal x ∨ Plant x))"

(* Explanation 5: Eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals or living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. (Eating e ∨ TakingInFood e) ⟶ (Get e Nutrients ∧ Get e Energy ∧ ((∃x. Animal x ∧ Agent e x) ∨ (∃x. LivingThing x ∧ Agent e x)))"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. Organism x ∧ Eat e x y ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ FoodSource y x"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ∧ Means y ⟶ Get y x"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. Herbivore x ⟶ (∀y. Plant y ⟶ Eat x y)"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Require y z ∧ Survival y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are dealing with a meadow ecosystem, a mouse, and a plant. *)
  (* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(L, D), Implies(a mouse is a kind of herbivore, green plants are a kind of producer) *)
  (* Since a mouse is a herbivore and herbivores only eat plants, we can infer that the plant is a source of food. *)
  from asm have "Plant z" <ATP>
  (* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
  (* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(K, D), Implies(herbivores only eat plants, green plants are a kind of producer) *)
  (* Since a mouse is a herbivore, we can infer that the mouse receives energy directly from plants. *)
  then have "Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Require y z ∧ Survival y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
