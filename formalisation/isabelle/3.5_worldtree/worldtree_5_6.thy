(* Explanation 1: a mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers; other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. FoodChainProcess x ∧ Animal y ∧ ConsumerRole z ∧ Eats e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 3: green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlants x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: food is a source of energy for animals; plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (EnergySourceForAnimals x ∧ EnergySourceForPlants x)"

(* Explanation 5: eating; taking in food is used to get nutrients; energy by animals; living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. Eating e ⟶ (GetNutrients e ∧ GetEnergy e ∧ ByAnimals e ∧ LivingThings (Patient e))"

(* Explanation 6: living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThings x ∧ Energy y ⟶ RequireEnergyForSurvival x y"

(* Explanation 7: an animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThings x"

(* Explanation 8: if an organism eats something then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y z. Organism x ∧ Eats y z ⟶ SourceOfFood z x"

(* Explanation 9: receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ⟷ Get y"

(* Explanation 10: herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Herbivores x ∧ Plants y ⟶ Eat x y"

(* Explanation 11: a mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivores x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mice y ∧ Plants z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mice y ∧ Plants z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ DirectlyFrom z x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are dealing with a meadow ecosystem, mice, and plants. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x" and "Mice y" and "Plants z" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(L, D), Implies(a mouse is a kind of herbivore, green plants are a kind of producer). *)
  (* Since a mouse is a kind of herbivore, and herbivores only eat plants, we can infer that mice eat plants. *)
  from `Mice y` and `a mouse is a kind of herbivore` have "Eat y z" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(I, E), Implies(if an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism, food is a source of energy for animals and plants). *)
  (* Since mice eat plants, and if an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism, we can infer that plants are a source of food for mice. *)
  from `Eat y z` and `if an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism` have "SourceOfFood z y" <ATP>
  
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(J, get), which means receive means get. *)
  (* Since receive means get, we can replace receive with get. *)
  from `Receive e` and `receive means get` have "Get e" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above information, we have all the necessary elements to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mice y ∧ Plants z ∧ Get e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ DirectlyFrom z x" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
