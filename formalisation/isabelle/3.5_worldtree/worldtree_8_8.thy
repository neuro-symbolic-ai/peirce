(* Explanation 1: Recording observations and data in a journal is a common practice in communicating the results of an investigation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data y ∧ Journal y ⟶ CommonPractice e ∧ In x e ∧ Communicating e ∧ ResultsOfInvestigation e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e RelativePH"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data y ∧ Journal y ∧ Communicating e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e ResultsOfInvestigation"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about Alan, cabbage juice, household solutions, and determination. *)
  from asm have "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e RelativePH" sledgehammer
  (* The relevant information for the hypothesis is about determining the relative pH. *)
  (* There is no direct connection between the premise and the hypothesis through the given axioms and explanations. *)
  (* We cannot directly infer the hypothesis from the premise using the provided information. *)
  (* Therefore, the proof cannot be completed with the given information. *)
  (* Additional axioms or logical relations are needed to establish a connection between the premise and the hypothesis. *)
