(* Explanation 1: People learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Person x ∧ School z ∧ Learn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Read y ∧ Write y ∧ In x z"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Trait x ⟷ Characteristic x"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ LearnedCharacteristic y ∧ AcquiredCharacteristic z ⟶ Opposite x y ∧ Opposite x z"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)

theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Read e ∧ Able e"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "LearnedTrait e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the entity can read and is able to read. *)
  from asm have "Read e" and "Able e" apply blast
  (* We have the explanation that people learn how to read and write in school. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(learn how to read and write in school, inherited characteristics) *)
  (* Since the entity can read, it implies that the entity has inherited characteristics. *)
  then have "InheritedCharacteristic e" by (simp add: assms)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(inherited characteristics, trait is synonymous with characteristic) *)
  (* Therefore, the entity having inherited characteristics means it has a trait synonymous with characteristic. *)
  then have "Trait e" sledgehammer
  (* Since trait is synonymous with characteristic, we can infer that the entity has characteristics. *)
  then have "Characteristic e" <ATP>
  (* We know that learned characteristics are the opposite of inherited characteristics. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Opposite(C, D), Opposite(inherited characteristics, learned characteristics; acquired characteristics) *)
  (* Therefore, the entity having characteristics implies it has learned characteristics. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristic e" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we aim to show that being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  (* Since the entity has learned characteristics, it satisfies the hypothesis. *)
  then show "LearnedTrait e" <ATP>
