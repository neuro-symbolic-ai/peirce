(* Explanation 1: Shape is a property of an object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Shape x ⟶ Property x (Object x)"

(* Explanation 2: Classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Classifying x ⟷ Grouping y ∧ Objects y ∧ Materials y ∧ ByProperties y"

(* Explanation 3: A leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 4: Classifying is a kind of science process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Classifying x ⟶ ScienceProcess x"

(* Explanation 5: Grouping means putting; placing in different groups. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Grouping x ⟷ Putting y ∧ Placing y ∧ InGroup y ∧ DifferentGroups y"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Students are studying some leaves. *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x y. Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Studying x y"
  (* Premise 2: They group the leaves by shape. *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x y. They x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Grouping x ∧ ByShape x y"
  (* Hypothesis: The students are using the science process of classifying when they put the leaves in different groups. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Student x ∧ ScienceProcess y ∧ Classifying z ∧ Leaves e ∧ Putting e ∧ InGroup e z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Time e y"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that students are studying leaves and grouping them by shape. *)
  from asm1 obtain x y where "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Studying x y" by auto
  from asm2 obtain x' y' where "They x' ∧ Leaves y' ∧ Grouping x' ∧ ByShape x' y'" by auto
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 3, we can infer that a leaf is an object. *)
  have "Object y'" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, E), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From the premise and the above inference, we can conclude that leaves are put in different groups. *)
  then have "InGroup y' z" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 4, we can deduce that classifying is a science process. *)
  have "ScienceProcess y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, B), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From the above inferences, we can conclude that classifying involves grouping by properties. *)
  then have "Classifying z" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can gather all the necessary components to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis by auto
