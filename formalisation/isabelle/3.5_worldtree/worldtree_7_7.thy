(* Explanation 1: An entity having the ability to read implies that they are able to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Entity x ∧ AbilityToRead y ⟶ Read y"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity has the ability to read, then it is an example of a learned trait. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Entity x ∧ AbilityToRead y ⟶ LearnedTrait x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Entity x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "∃x. Read x ∧ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the entity x exists. *)
  from asm have "Entity x" by auto
  (* We have two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1: An entity having the ability to read implies that they are able to read. *)
  (* Explanation 2: If an entity has the ability to read, then it is an example of a learned trait. *)
  (* We can combine these two explanations to infer that if an entity has the ability to read, it is both able to read and an example of a learned trait. *)
  have "AbilityToRead x ⟶ Read x ∧ LearnedTrait x" using assms explanation_1 explanation_2 by blast
  (* Since we know that the entity x exists, we can conclude that there exists an x such that it can read and is an example of a learned trait. *)
