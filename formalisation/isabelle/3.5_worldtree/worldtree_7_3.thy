(* Explanation 1: An entity with learned traits is characterized by exhibiting traits that are synonymous with characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Entity x ∧ LearnedTrait e ⟶ (Exhibiting e ∧ Characteristic e)"

(* Explanation 2: Learned traits in an entity are directly linked to the traits that are synonymous with characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Entity x ∧ LearnedTrait e ⟶ (Linked e ∧ Characteristic e)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Read e ∧ Able e"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "LearnedTrait e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the event e involves reading and being able to read. *)
  (* We can infer that the event e is linked to the ability to read. *)
  have "Linked e ∧ Characteristic e" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(traits that are synonymous with characteristics, exhibiting traits that are synonymous with characteristics) *)
  (* We can derive that the event e, which is linked to the ability to read, exhibits traits synonymous with characteristics. *)
  then have "Exhibiting e" by <ATP>
  (* Since the event e exhibits traits synonymous with characteristics, we can conclude that the event e involves a learned trait. *)
  then show ?thesis by <ATP>
