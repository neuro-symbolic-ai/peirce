(* Explanation 1: Hawaii being far from the United States mainland implies that Hawaii is a distant location. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Hawaii x ∧ FarFrom x UnitedStatesMainland ⟶ DistantLocation x"

(* Explanation 2: If Hawaii is a distant location, then the available types of food in Hawaii will increase as the ability to transport food increases around the world. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Hawaii x ∧ DistantLocation x ⟶ (Increase e ∧ AvailableTypesOfFood y ∧ In y x ∧ AroundWorld z ∧ TransportFood z ∧ IncreaseAbility z)"

(* Explanation 3: Therefore, the increase in available types of food in Hawaii due to improved food transportation can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z w e1 e2. Increase e1 ∧ AvailableTypesOfFood x ∧ In Hawaii x ∧ DueTo e1 ImprovedFoodTransportation ∧ Help e2 ∧ Can e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ IndirectObject e2 y ∧ DirectObject e2 z ∧ InStores z ∧ FoodOptions w ∧ VarietyOf w"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. NewTechnology x ∧ Help e ∧ Might e ∧ Agent e x ∧ IndirectObject e y ∧ DirectObject e z ∧ InStores z ∧ AvailableTypesOfFood z ∧ FoodType z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Hawaii is far from the United States mainland. *)
  have "Hawaii x ∧ FarFrom x UnitedStatesMainland" sorry
  (* Using the logical relation Implies(A, B), we can infer that Hawaii is a distant location. *)
  then have "DistantLocation x" sorry
  (* Since Hawaii is a distant location, according to Explanation 2, the available types of food in Hawaii will increase as the ability to transport food increases around the world. *)
  have "Increase e ∧ AvailableTypesOfFood y ∧ In y x ∧ AroundWorld z ∧ TransportFood z ∧ IncreaseAbility z" sorry
  (* This increase in available types of food in Hawaii due to improved food transportation can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores, as stated in Explanation 3. *)
  then have "Help e2 ∧ Can e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ IndirectObject e2 y ∧ DirectObject e2 z ∧ InStores z ∧ FoodOptions w ∧ VarietyOf w" sorry
  (* Therefore, the new technology that might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores can be represented as follows. *)
  then show ?thesis sorry
