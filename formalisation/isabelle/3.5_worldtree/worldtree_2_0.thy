(* Explanation 1: as ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. TransportAbility e1 ∧ Increase e1 ∧ World e1 ⟶ (FoodTypes e2 ∧ Increase e2 ∧ DistantLocations e2)"

(* Explanation 2: as ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e1 e2. PreserveAbility e1 ∧ Increase e1 ⟶ (TransportAbility e2 ∧ Increase e2)"

(* Explanation 3: to preserve food means to keep fresh food from spoiling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e. PreserveFood e ⟷ (KeepFresh e ∧ Spoiling e)"

(* Explanation 4: having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀e. VarietyFoods e ∧ Available e ⟶ (PositiveImpact e ∧ PeopleLives e)"

(* Explanation 5: variety means different kinds; different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x ⟷ (DifferentKinds x ∧ DifferentTypes y)"

(* Explanation 6: helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀e. Help e ⟶ (PositiveImpact e ∧ Something e)"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "FarFrom Hawaii UnitedStatesMainland"

(* Explanation 8: far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x. Far x ⟷ GreatDistance x"

(* Explanation 9: distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x. Distant x ⟷ GreatDistance x"

(* Explanation 10: the United States of America is a kind of location *)
axiomatization where

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ FoundWay e ∧ KeepFresh e ∧ FoodsSpoiling e ∧ Transporting y ∧ LongDistances z"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃e. Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ PeopleInHawaii e ∧ Increase e ∧ FoodTypes e ∧ AvailableInStores e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances. *)
  (* This relates to the ability to preserve food and keep fresh food from spoiling. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, G), Implies(to preserve food, keep fresh food from spoiling) *)
  from asm have "FoundWay e ∧ KeepFresh e ∧ FoodsSpoiling e" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 3, we can infer that the found way is related to preserving food. *)
  (* This implies that the ability to preserve food increases. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, C), Implies(to preserve food, ability to preserve food increases) *)
  then have "PreserveAbility e" <ATP>
  (* The increase in the ability to preserve food leads to an increase in the ability to transport food. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(ability to preserve food increases, ability to transport food increases around the world) *)
  then have "TransportAbility e'" for e' <ATP>
  (* The increase in the ability to transport food around the world results in an increase in the available types of food in distant locations. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(ability to transport food increases around the world, available types of food in distant locations will increase) *)
  then have "FoodTypes e'' ∧ Increase e'' ∧ DistantLocations e''" for e'' <ATP>
  (* The increase in available types of food in distant locations has a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, E), Implies(available types of food in distant locations will increase, positive impact on people's lives) *)
  then have "PositiveImpact e'' ∧ PeopleLives e''" for e'' <ATP>
  (* Having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(having a variety of foods available, positive impact on people's lives) *)
  then have "VarietyFoods e'' ∧ Available e''" for e'' <ATP>
  (* Variety means different kinds; different types. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(H, I), Equivalent(variety means different kinds; different types, helping something) *)
  then have "Help e''" for e'' <ATP>
  (* Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(J, L), Implies(Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland, distant means great in distance) *)
  then have "Distant Hawaii" <ATP>
  (* Distant means great in distance. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(K, L), Equivalent(far means great in distance, distant means great in distance) *)
  then have "GreatDistance Hawaii" <ATP>
  (* The above steps show that the new technology can help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
