(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers; other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Animal x ∧ Role e ∧ Consumer e ∧ Eats e z ∧ Producers y ∧ OtherAnimals z ∧ Food z"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlants x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals; plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ Energy x ∧ (Animals x ∨ Plants x)"

(* Explanation 5: Eating; taking in food is used to get nutrients; energy by animals; living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e1 e2. Eating e1 ∧ TakingInFood e1 ⟶ Get e2 ∧ Nutrients e2 ∧ Energy e2 ∧ Animals e2 ∧ LivingThings e2"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThings x ∧ Energy y ⟶ Require x y ∧ Survival x y"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThings x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y z. Organism x ∧ Eats y z ⟶ SourceOfFood z x"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ⟷ Get y"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Herbivores x ⟶ Eat y ∧ Plants y"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivores x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Meadow x ∧ Ecosystem y"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Meadow x ∧ Ecosystem y ∧ Mouse z ∧ Plant e ∧ Energy e ∧ Need z e ∧ Survive z e ∧ DirectlyFrom e x"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have Meadow x and Ecosystem y. *)
  have "Meadow x" and "Ecosystem y" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 11, we know that a mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
  then have "Mouse z" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 10, we know that herbivores only eat plants. *)
  then have "Plant e" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 4, we know that food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
  then have "Energy e" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 6, we know that living things all require energy for survival. *)
  then have "Need z e" and "Survive z e" <ATP>
  (* Finally, the energy needed by a mouse comes directly from plants in a meadow ecosystem. *)
