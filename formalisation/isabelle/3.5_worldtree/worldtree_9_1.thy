(* Explanation 1: If an object reflects a light of a certain color, then the object appears to be that color *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1_1: "∀x y e. Object x ∧ Light y ∧ Color y ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
  explanation_1_2: "∀x y e. Object x ∧ Color y ∧ Appears e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

(* Explanation 2: If an object appears to be a certain color, then it reflects a light of that color *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2_1: "∀x y e. Object x ∧ Color y ∧ Appears e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
  explanation_2_2: "∀x y e. Object x ∧ Light y ∧ Color y ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light *)
  shows "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ∧ Reflects e ∧ GreenLight e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that leaves are objects. *)
  from asm have "Object x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical propositions A and B, and their relations. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an object reflects a light of a certain color, the object appears to be that color) *)
  (* We can use this relation to infer that if an object reflects green light, it appears green. *)
  from explanation_1_1 and asm have "Object x ∧ Light Green ∧ Color Green ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e Green" <ATP>
  then have "Object x ∧ Color Green ∧ Appears Green ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e Green" <ATP>
  then have "Object x ∧ Appears Green" <ATP>
  (* We can also use the relation Implies(B, A) to infer that if an object appears green, it reflects green light. *)
  from explanation_2_2 and asm have "Object x ∧ Light Green ∧ Color Green ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e Green" <ATP>
  then have "Object x ∧ Reflects e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
