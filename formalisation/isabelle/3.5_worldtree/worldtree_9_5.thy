(* Explanation 1: Leaves are objects. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Leaves x ⟶ Objects x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
 shows "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ∧ Reflect e ∧ GreenLight e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that leaves are objects. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x" by simp
  (* Since leaves are objects, we can infer that the leaves are objects. *)
  then have "Objects x" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* The hypothesis states that many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
  (* We can introduce a new event e where the leaves appear green, reflect, and are under green light. *)
  then have "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ∧ Reflect e ∧ GreenLight e" sledgehammer
