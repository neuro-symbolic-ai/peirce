(* Explanation 1: If Hawaii is far from the United States mainland, then the ability to transport food increases around the world *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Hawaii x ∧ UnitedStatesMainland y ⟶ FarFrom x y ∧ TransportFoodAbility e ∧ Increases e ∧ AroundWorld e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ TransportingLongDistances e ∧ Found e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e e (KeepFreshFoods e)"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e. NewTechnology x ∧ People y ∧ Hawaii z ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Purpose e (IncreaseFoodTypes e) ∧ AvailableInStores e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the grocery company, way, fresh foods, spoiling, transporting long distances, and purpose of keeping fresh foods. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x ∧ Way y ∧ FreshFoods z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ TransportingLongDistances e ∧ Found e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Purpose e e (KeepFreshFoods e)" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Hawaii is far from the United States mainland, the ability to transport food increases around the world) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We need to use the relevant information to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Since the premise does not directly provide information about Hawaii being far from the United States mainland, we cannot directly infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* Therefore, we cannot prove the hypothesis based on the given premise and explanations. *)
