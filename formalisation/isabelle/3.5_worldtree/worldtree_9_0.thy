(* Explanation 1: if an object reflects a light of a certain color then the object appears to be that color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Object x ∧ Light y ∧ Color z ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Appears e z ⟶ Be x z"

(* Explanation 2: a leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 3: green is a kind of color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Green x ⟶ Color x"

(* Explanation 4: a leaf is often green in color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∃x y z. Leaf x ∧ Often y ∧ Green z ∧ InColor x z"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Leaf x ∧ Many x ∧ Green y ∧ Light z"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Leaf x ∧ Many x ∧ Green y ∧ Light z ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Because e (Green y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that a leaf is often green in color, and green is a kind of color. *)
  from asm have "Leaf x" and "Green y" apply meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(green is a kind of color, leaf is often green in color) *)
  (* We can infer that the leaf x is often green in color. *)
  then have "Leaf x ∧ Often y ∧ Green y" by (simp add: assms)
  (* From the known information, we can infer that the leaf x is an object. *)
  from explanation_2 have "Leaf x ⟶ Object x" by simp
  then have "Object x" using assms by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(leaf is a kind of object, object reflects a light of a certain color) *)
  (* We can infer that the object x reflects a light of a certain color. *)
  then have "Object x ∧ Light z ∧ Color y" by (simp add: assms explanation_3)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(object reflects a light of a certain color, object appears to be that color) *)
  (* We can infer that the object x appears to be green in color. *)
  then have "Object x ∧ Light z ∧ Color y ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Appears e y" sledgehammer
  (* From the explanatory sentence 1, we can conclude that the object x appears to be green in color. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∀x y z e. Object x ∧ Light y ∧ Color z ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Appears e z ⟶ Be x z" <ATP>
  then have "Be x y" <ATP>
  (* We can further infer that the object x appears to be green in color. *)
  then have "Object x ∧ Light z ∧ Color y ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Because e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
