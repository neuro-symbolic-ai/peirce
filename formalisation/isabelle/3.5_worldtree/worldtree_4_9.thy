(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow, then it is likely to be yellow *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Yellow x ⟶ Yellow x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is yellow and a mineral, then it is likely to be yellow *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Yellow x ∧ Mineral x ⟶ Yellow x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Identify e"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ∧ Mineral x ⟶ Yellow x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Yellow x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A and B, A), Implies(an entity is a mineral, an entity is yellow) *)
  (* Yellow x is from the premise, so we can infer Mineral x. *)
  then have "Sample x ∧ Yellow x ∧ Mineral x" sledgehammer
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states if an entity is yellow and a mineral, then it is likely to be yellow. *)
  (* Yellow x and Mineral x are both from the premise, so we can infer Yellow x. *)
  then have "Yellow x" <ATP>
  (* We need to prove that Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow, which means for all x, if x is Sulfur and x is a Mineral, then x is Yellow. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
