(* Explanation 1: Shape is a property of an object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Shape x ⟶ Property x Object"

(* Explanation 2: Classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Classifying x ⟷ Grouping y ∧ Objects y ∧ Materials y ∧ ByProperties x y"

(* Explanation 3: A leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 4: Classifying is a kind of science process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Classifying x ⟶ ScienceProcess x"

(* Explanation 5: Grouping means putting; placing in different groups. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Grouping x ⟷ Putting y ∧ Placing y ∧ DifferentGroups y"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Students are studying some leaves. *)
  assumes asm1: "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Study e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
  (* Premise 2: They group the leaves by shape. *)
  assumes asm2: "They x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Group e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ByShape y"
  (* Hypothesis: The students are using the science process of classifying when they put the leaves in different groups. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Student x ∧ ScienceProcess y ∧ Classifying z ∧ Leaves e ∧ Put e ∧ InGroup e z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Time e y"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that students are studying leaves and grouping them by shape. *)
  from asm1 have "Student x" and "Leaves y" and "Study e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" <ATP>
  from asm2 have "They x" and "Leaves y" and "Group e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" and "ByShape y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From Explanation 3, we can infer that a leaf is an object, which relates to classifying. *)
  then have "Object y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying is a kind of science process) *)
  (* From Explanation 4, we can infer that classifying is a science process. *)
  then have "ScienceProcess y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(B, E), Implies(classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From Explanation 2, we can infer that grouping means putting in different groups. *)
  then have "Putting e" and "Placing e" and "DifferentGroups e" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From the above inferences, we can conclude that the students are using the science process of classifying when they group the leaves by shape. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
