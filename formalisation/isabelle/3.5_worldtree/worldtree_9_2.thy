(* Explanation 1: If an object reflects a light of a certain color, then the object appears to be that color *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Object x ∧ Light y ∧ Color z ∧ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ OfColor y z ⟶ Appears e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z"

(* Explanation 2: If an object appears to be a certain color, then it reflects a light of that color *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Object x ∧ Color y ∧ Appears e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ToBe y z ⟶ Reflects e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Leaves x ∧ Many y ∧ Green z"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Leaves x ∧ Many y ∧ Green z ∧ Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Reflect e y ∧ GreenLight y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about leaves, many, and green. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x ∧ Many y ∧ Green z" by auto
  (* There are two relevant explanatory sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1: If an object reflects a light of a certain color, then the object appears to be that color. *)
  (* Explanation 2: If an object appears to be a certain color, then it reflects a light of that color. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to infer that if something appears green, it reflects green light. *)
  (* Since many leaves appear green, we can conclude that they reflect green light. *)
  then have "Reflect e y ∧ GreenLight y" sledgehammer
  (* We already have information about leaves, many, green, reflect, and green light. *)
  then have "Leaves x ∧ Many y ∧ Green z ∧ Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Reflect e y ∧ GreenLight y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
