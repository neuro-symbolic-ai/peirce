theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Energy e ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Need y z ∧ Survive y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are dealing with a meadow ecosystem, a mouse, and a plant. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition L: a mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(L, K), Implies(a mouse is a kind of herbivore, herbivores only eat plants). *)
  (* Since a mouse is a herbivore, it only eats plants. *)
  (* This implies that the plant z is the source of food for the mouse y. *)
  then have "SourceOf z Food" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition E: food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, G), Implies(food is a source of energy for animals and plants, living things all require energy for survival). *)
  (* Since food is a source of energy, the mouse y can obtain energy from the plant z. *)
  then have "Energy e" for some e <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical proposition J: receive means get. *)
  (* From J, we can infer that the mouse y receives the energy e. *)
  then have "Receive e" <ATP>
  (* The mouse y is the agent of receiving the energy e. *)
  then have "Agent e y" <ATP>
  (* The plant z is the source of the energy e for the mouse y. *)
  then have "Patient e z" <ATP>
  (* The mouse y needs the energy e from the plant z. *)
  then have "Need y z" <ATP>
  (* Finally, the mouse y can survive with the energy e obtained from the plant z. *)
  then have "Survive y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that in a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
