(* Explanation 1: Alaska being a state implies that it experiences the same seasonal changes as the rest of the United States *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Alaska x ∧ State x ⟶ (∀y. UnitedStates y ⟶ SeasonalChanges x y)"

(* Explanation 2: Given that Alaska is in the United States and the Earth's tilt causes seasons, it follows that Alaska experiences winter as a season *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Alaska x ∧ UnitedStates y ∧ EarthTilt z ⟶ (Causes z Winter ∧ Experiences x Winter)"

(* Explanation 3: The premise mentioning fewer daylight hours in winter in Alaska implies that winter is characterized by specific environmental conditions related to the Earth's tilt *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. Alaska x ∧ Winter y ∧ FewerDaylightHours y ⟶ (CharacterizedBy y EnvironmentalConditions ∧ RelatedTo y EarthTilt)"

(* Explanation 4: Combining the information that Alaska is in the United States, experiences winter, and the Earth's tilt causes seasons, we can deduce that in winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. Alaska x ∧ UnitedStates y ∧ Experiences x Winter ∧ EarthTilt z ⟶ (∃e. NorthernHemisphere e ∧ Winter e ∧ TiltedAway e Sun)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: in alaska, there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter than in the summer *)
  assumes asm: "Alaska x ∧ Winter y ∧ Summer z ∧ FewerDaylightHours y ∧ MoreHoursDaylight z"
  (* Hypothesis: The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter *)
  shows "∀x. NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Winter y ⟶ TiltedAway x Sun"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can deduce that Alaska x, Winter y, and FewerDaylightHours y are true. *)
  from asm have "Alaska x" and "Winter y" and "FewerDaylightHours y" <ATP>
  (* We know from Explanation 3 that Winter is characterized by specific environmental conditions related to the Earth's tilt. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, E), Implies(Winter is characterized by specific environmental conditions related to the Earth's tilt, Alaska experiences winter as a season) *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that Alaska experiences winter as a season. *)
  then have "Alaska x ∧ Experiences x Winter" <ATP>
  (* Given that Alaska is in the United States and the Earth's tilt causes seasons, we can conclude that in winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies((C and E and D), G), Implies(Earth's tilt causes seasons, In winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun) *)
  (* Combining the information that Alaska is in the United States, experiences winter, and the Earth's tilt causes seasons, we can deduce that in winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun. *)
  then have "∃e. NorthernHemisphere e ∧ Winter e ∧ TiltedAway e Sun" <ATP>
  (* Since the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in winter, for any x, if x is in the Northern Hemisphere and it is winter, then x is tilted away from the Sun. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
