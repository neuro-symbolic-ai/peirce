(* Explanation 1: Shape is a property of an object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Shape x ⟶ Property x (Object x)"

(* Explanation 2: Classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Classifying x ⟷ Grouping y ∧ Objects y ∧ Materials y ∧ ByProperties y x"

(* Explanation 3: A leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 4: Classifying is a kind of science process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Classifying x ⟶ ScienceProcess x"

(* Explanation 5: Grouping means putting; placing in different groups. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Grouping x ⟷ Putting y ∧ Placing y ∧ InGroup y x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Students are studying some leaves. *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x y. Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Study x y"
  (* Premise 2: They group the leaves by shape. *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x y. Leaves x ∧ Shape y ∧ Grouping x ∧ ByProperties x y"
  (* Hypothesis: The students are using the science process of classifying when they put the leaves in different groups. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Student x ∧ ScienceProcess y ∧ Classifying z ∧ Leaves e ∧ Putting e ∧ InGroup e z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Time e y"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that students are studying leaves and grouping them by shape. *)
  from asm1 obtain x y where "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Study x y" by auto
  from asm2 obtain a b where "Leaves a ∧ Shape b ∧ Grouping a ∧ ByProperties a b" by auto
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 3, we can infer that a leaf is a kind of object. *)
  hence "Object a" by (rule explanation_3)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(shape is a property of an object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From the premise and explanatory sentence 1, we can infer that shape is a property of an object. *)
  hence "Property b a" by (rule explanation_1)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(B, E), Implies(classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From the logical relation and explanatory sentence 2, we can infer that grouping means putting; placing in different groups. *)
  hence "Putting a ∧ Placing a ∧ InGroup a b" by (rule explanation_2)
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From the logical relation and explanatory sentence 4, we can infer that classifying is a kind of science process. *)
  hence "ScienceProcess a" by (rule explanation_4)
  (* Combining the above information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis by auto
