(* Explanation 1: For many leaves to appear green, there must be a specific event where they reflect green light. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ⟶ (∃e1. ReflectGreenLight e1 ∧ Cause e e1)"

(* Explanation 2: The reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event that leads to their green appearance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e. Leaves x ∧ ReflectGreenLight e ⟶ (CrucialEvent e ∧ LeadsTo e e x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
  shows "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ∧ ReflectGreenLight e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about leaves. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x" <ATP>
  (* We can use Explanation 1 to infer that for leaves to appear green, there must be an event where they reflect green light. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(many leaves appear green, there is a specific event where leaves reflect green light) *)
  (* We can apply Explanation 1 to get the existence of an event where leaves reflect green light. *)
  then obtain e1 where "ReflectGreenLight e1 ∧ Cause e e1" <ATP>
  (* Using Explanation 2, we know that the reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event that leads to their green appearance. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(C, D), Equivalent(the reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event, leads to leaves' green appearance) *)
  (* We can conclude that the event of reflecting green light is crucial and leads to the green appearance of leaves. *)
  then obtain e where "CrucialEvent e ∧ LeadsTo e x" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we have shown that there exists an event where leaves appear green and reflect green light. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
