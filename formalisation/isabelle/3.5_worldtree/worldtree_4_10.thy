(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow, then it is likely to be a mineral *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Yellow x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ Likely x)"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is a mineral, then it is likely to be yellow *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Mineral x ⟶ (Yellow x ∧ Likely x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Identify e"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Her x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ Likely x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Her x ∧ Yellow x" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an entity is yellow, an entity is a mineral) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have Yellow x, so we can infer Mineral x and Likely x. *)
  then have "Mineral x ∧ Likely x" for x sledgehammer
  (* Since Sulfur is a mineral, we can conclude that Sulfur is likely to be yellow. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
