(* Explanation 1: If an object appears green, then it reflects green light. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Object x ∧ Green y ⟶ (Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y) ⟶ Reflect e y GreenLight"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
 shows "∃x y e. Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Reflect e y GreenLight"
proof -
  (* From the known information about leaves, we can infer that leaves are objects. *)
  from asm have "Object x" sledgehammer
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that if an object appears green, then it reflects green light. *)
  (* We can use this to connect the concept of appearing green and reflecting green light. *)
  (* Since leaves are objects, we can apply the explanatory sentence to leaves. *)
  (* This allows us to conclude that leaves reflect green light if they appear green. *)
  then have "Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ Reflect e y GreenLight" <ATP>
  (* Given that leaves are the objects that reflect green light, we can deduce that they are green. *)
  then have "Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Reflect e y GreenLight" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
