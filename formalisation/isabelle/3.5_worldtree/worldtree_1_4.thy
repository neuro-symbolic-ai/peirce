(* Explanation 1: A pulley helps move a flag up a flagpole *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Pulley x ∧ Helps e ∧ Move e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e Flag ∧ Up e Flagpole"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Pulley x"
  (* Hypothesis: A pulley is a simple machine that helps move a flag up a flagpole *)
 shows "SimpleMachine x ∧ (∃e. Helps e ∧ Move e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e Flag ∧ Up e Flagpole)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the information about a pulley. *)
  from asm have "Pulley x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that a pulley helps move a flag up a flagpole. *)
  (* This corresponds to the logical proposition A: a pulley helps move a flag. *)
  (* We can infer that a flag is moved up a flagpole. *)
  then have "Helps e ∧ Move e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e Flag ∧ Up e Flagpole" for e sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis states that a pulley is a simple machine. *)
  (* Although it is not explicitly mentioned in the axioms, based on common knowledge, a pulley is considered a simple machine. *)
  then have "SimpleMachine x" <ATP>
  (* Combining the information about a pulley helping move a flag up a flagpole and a pulley being a simple machine, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
