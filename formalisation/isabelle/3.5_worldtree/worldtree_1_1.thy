(* Explanation 1: A pulley is used to lift a flag on a flagpole. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Pulley x ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e ∧ Lift e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Destination e e"

(* Explanation 2: A pulley is a kind of simple machine. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Pulley x ⟶ SimpleMachine x"

(* Explanation 3: To lift means to move up. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Lift x ⟷ MoveUp y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e"
  (* Hypothesis: A pulley is a simple machine that helps move a flag up a flagpole. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e ∧ MoveUp e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Destination e e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the pulley, simple machine, flag, and flagpole. *)
  from asm have "Pulley x" and "SimpleMachine y" and "Flag z" and "Flagpole e" <ATP>
  
  (* We know that a pulley is a kind of simple machine from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(to lift means to move up, a pulley is a kind of simple machine) *)
  (* Since to lift means to move up, and a pulley is a kind of simple machine, we can infer that a pulley helps move a flag up a flagpole. *)
  from explanation_2 and explanation_3 have "Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ⟶ Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ MoveUp e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Destination e e" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "∃x y z e. Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e ∧ MoveUp e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Destination e e" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
