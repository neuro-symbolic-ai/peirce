(* Explanation 1: Inherited characteristics imply that the entity has traits that are synonymous with characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. InheritedCharacteristics x ∧ Traits y ⟶ Synonymous x y"

(* Explanation 2: Therefore, an entity with inherited characteristics also exhibits traits that are synonymous with characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. InheritedCharacteristics x ∧ Traits y ⟶ Exhibits x y ∧ Synonymous x y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x can read. *)
  from asm have "Read x" by simp
  (* We have the logical proposition A and B from the explanation sentences. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Inherited characteristics, entity has traits that are synonymous with characteristics) *)
  (* Since x has the ability to read, it implies that x has traits synonymous with characteristics. *)
  then have "Traits x" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(Inherited characteristics, entity exhibits traits that are synonymous with characteristics) *)
  (* As x has inherited characteristics, it implies that x exhibits traits synonymous with characteristics. *)
  then have "Exhibits x x ∧ Synonymous x x" <ATP>
  (* Since x exhibits traits synonymous with characteristics, it implies that x has learned traits. *)
  then have "LearnedTrait x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
