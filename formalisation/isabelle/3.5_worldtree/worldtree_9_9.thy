(* Explanation 1: The event of leaves reflecting green light causes their green appearance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. Reflect e1 ∧ GreenLight e1 ∧ GreenAppearance e2 ∧ Cause e2 e1"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light *)
 shows "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ∧ Reflect e ∧ GreenLight e ∧ Cause e x"
