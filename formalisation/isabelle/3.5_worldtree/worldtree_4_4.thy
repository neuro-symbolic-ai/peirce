(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow in color and contains sulfur, then it is likely to be a mineral. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (YellowColor x ∧ ContainsSulfur x) ⟶ LikelyMineral x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Given e x (Minerals y ∧ Identify e)"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Her janet x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Janet has been given some minerals to identify and one of her samples is yellow. *)
  (* We can infer that the sample is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Her janet x ∧ Yellow x" by simp
  (* Given the explanation sentence, if an entity is yellow in color and contains sulfur, then it is likely to be a mineral. *)
  (* We can relate the yellow sample to the likely mineral. *)
  have "YellowColor x ∧ ContainsSulfur x ⟶ LikelyMineral x" for x using explanation_1 by blast
  (* Since the sample is yellow, we can infer that it contains sulfur and is likely a mineral. *)
  then have "ContainsSulfur x ∧ LikelyMineral x" sledgehammer
  (* We can further deduce that if an entity contains sulfur, then it is a mineral. *)
  then have "ContainsSulfur x ⟶ Mineral x" for x <ATP>
  (* Additionally, if an entity is likely a mineral, then it is likely yellow. *)
  then have "LikelyMineral x ⟶ LikelyYellow x" for x <ATP>
  (* Combining the above implications, we can conclude that sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
