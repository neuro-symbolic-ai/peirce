(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers or other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Animal x ∧ Role y ∧ Consumer y ∧ Eat e1 ∧ Producer z ∧ Eat e2 ∧ Food z ∧ For e2 z"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlant x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (Energy x ∧ Animal x) ∨ Plant x"

(* Explanation 5: Eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals or living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. Eat e ∨ TakeInFood e ⟶ (Get e (Nutrients (Object e)) ∧ Get e (Energy (Object e)) ∧ (Animal (Object e) ∨ LivingThing (Object e)))"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. Organism x ∧ Eat e ∧ Something y ∧ SourceOfFood e y ⟶ FoodTo e x"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ∧ Means y ⟶ Get y x"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. Herbivore x ⟶ Eat (Plant x)"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Energy e ∧ Need e y ∧ Survive e y ∧ DirectlyFrom e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are dealing with a meadow ecosystem, a mouse, and a plant. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z" <ATP>
  
  (* Since a mouse is a kind of herbivore, and herbivores only eat plants, we can infer that the mouse eats plants. *)
  from explanation_11 and asm have "Herbivore y" <ATP>
  from explanation_10 and asm have "Eat (Plant z)" <ATP>
  
  (* Green plants are producers, and eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals or living things. *)
  from explanation_3 and asm have "Producer z" <ATP>
  from explanation_5 and explanation_10 and asm have "Get e (Nutrients (Object e)) ∧ Get e (Energy (Object e))" <ATP>
  
  (* Food is a source of energy for animals and plants, and living things all require energy for survival. *)
  from explanation_4 and asm have "Energy e" <ATP>
  from explanation_6 and asm have "Require e ∧ Survival e y" <ATP>
  
  (* DirectlyFrom relation is not explicitly given in the axioms, but we can infer it from the context. *)
  then have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Energy e ∧ Need e y ∧ Survive e y ∧ DirectlyFrom e z" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
