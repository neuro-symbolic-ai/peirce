(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers or other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Animal x ∧ Role y ∧ Consumer y ∧ Eat x e1 ∧ Producer z ∧ Eat e2 ∧ Food e2 ∧ SourceOf e2 z"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlant x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (Energy x ∧ Animal x) ∨ Plant x"

(* Explanation 5: Eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals or living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e1 e2. Eat e1 e2 ∨ TakeInFood e1 ⟶ (Get e1 e2 ∧ Nutrients e2 ∧ Energy e2 ∧ Animal e2) ∨ LivingThing e2"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThing x ∧ Energy y ⟶ Require x y ∧ Survival x"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y z. Organism x ∧ Eat y z ⟶ (Food z ∧ SourceOf z x)"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ∧ Means y ⟶ Get x y"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. Herbivore x ⟶ Eat x Plant"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Meadow x ∧ Ecosystem y ∧ Mouse z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Meadow x ∧ Ecosystem y ∧ Mouse z ∧ Plant e ∧ Energy e ∧ Require z e ∧ Survival z ∧ SourceOf e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are dealing with a meadow ecosystem and a mouse. *)
  from asm have "Meadow x ∧ Ecosystem y ∧ Mouse z" <ATP>
  
  (* Since a mouse is a kind of herbivore, and herbivores only eat plants, we can infer that the mouse eats plants. *)
  from explanation_11 and explanation_10 have "Herbivore z" <ATP>
  from explanation_10 have "Eat z Plant" <ATP>
  
  (* Green plants are producers, and food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
  from explanation_3 have "Producer e" <ATP>
  from explanation_4 have "Food e ⟶ (Energy e ∧ Animal e) ∨ Plant e" <ATP>
  
  (* Since the mouse eats plants, and plants are producers, the mouse receives energy from plants. *)
  from `Eat z Plant` and `Producer e` have "SourceOf e z" <ATP>
  from `Food e ⟶ (Energy e ∧ Animal e) ∨ Plant e` have "Energy e" <ATP>
  
  (* Living things require energy for survival. *)
  from explanation_6 have "LivingThing z ∧ Energy e ⟶ Require z e ∧ Survival z" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining all the above information, we can conclude that the mouse receives most of the energy it needs to survive directly from plants. *)
  then have "Meadow x ∧ Ecosystem y ∧ Mouse z ∧ Plant e ∧ Energy e ∧ Require z e ∧ Survival z ∧ SourceOf e z" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
