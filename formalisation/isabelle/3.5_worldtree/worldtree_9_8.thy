(* Explanation 1: For many leaves to appear green, there must be a specific event where they reflect green light *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ⟶ (∃e1. Reflect e1 ∧ GreenLight e1 ∧ Cause e e1)"

(* Explanation 2: The reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event that leads to their green appearance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e1 e2. Leaves x ∧ Reflect e1 ∧ GreenLight e1 ⟶ (CrucialEvent e2 ∧ LeadsTo e2 e1 ∧ GreenAppearance e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light *)
 shows "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ AppearGreen e ∧ Reflect e ∧ GreenLight e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there are leaves x. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x" by auto
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that for many leaves to appear green, there must be a specific event where they reflect green light. *)
  (* This implies that if leaves x appear green, there is an event e where they reflect green light. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that there exists an event e where leaves x appear green and reflect green light. *)
  then have "∃e. AppearGreen e ∧ Reflect e ∧ GreenLight e" sledgehammer
  (* This satisfies the hypothesis, so we can conclude. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
