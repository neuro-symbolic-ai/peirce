(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow, then it is likely to be yellow. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Yellow x ⟶ LikelyYellow x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Identify e"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Yellow x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, A), which is always true. *)
  (* This implies that if an entity is yellow, it is likely to be yellow. *)
  (* Since the sample is yellow, it is likely to be yellow. *)
  then have "LikelyYellow x" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* We need to show that Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  (* To prove this, we need to show that if x is Sulfur, then x is a mineral and likely to be yellow. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
