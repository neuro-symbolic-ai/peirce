(* Explanation 1: Hawaii being far from the United States mainland implies that Hawaii is a distant location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Hawaii x ⟶ DistantLocation x"

(* Explanation 2: If Hawaii is a distant location, then the available types of food in Hawaii will increase as the ability to transport food increases around the world *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Hawaii x ∧ DistantLocation x ⟶ (Increase y ∧ AvailableTypesOfFoodInHawaii y ∧ TransportFood z ∧ Increase z ∧ AroundWorld z)"

(* Explanation 3: Therefore, the increase in available types of food in Hawaii due to improved food transportation can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃x y z e1 e2. Increase x ∧ AvailableTypesOfFoodInHawaii x ∧ ImprovedFoodTransportation y ∧ Help e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ IndirectObject e1 z ∧ DirectObject e1 y ∧ PeopleInHawaii z ∧ VarietyOfFoodOptionsInStores y"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: none *)
  assumes asm: ""
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃x y z e. NewTechnology x ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e x ∧ IndirectObject e y ∧ DirectObject e z ∧ PeopleInHawaii y ∧ TypesOfFoodAvailableInStores z"
proof -
  (* From the logical relations, we know that Implies(B, G) and Implies(B, F) *)
  (* Since Hawaii is a distant location (B), it implies providing a variety of food options in stores (G) and help people in Hawaii (F) *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that Hawaii being a distant location can help people in Hawaii and provide a variety of food options in stores. *)
  from asm have "Hawaii x" <ATP>
  (* From the derived implication Implies(A, F), we can conclude that Hawaii being far from the United States mainland can help people in Hawaii. *)
  then have "Help e ∧ Agent e x ∧ IndirectObject e y ∧ DirectObject e z ∧ PeopleInHawaii y" <ATP>
  (* Since Hawaii is a distant location (B), it implies providing a variety of food options in stores (G) *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that Hawaii being a distant location can provide a variety of food options in stores. *)
  then have "TypesOfFoodAvailableInStores z" <ATP>
  (* We also need to introduce the concept of new technology. *)
  have "NewTechnology x" by <ATP>
  (* Combining all the above inferences, we can conclude that the new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  then show ?thesis by <ATP>
