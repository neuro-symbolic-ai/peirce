(* Explanation 1: greatest means largest; highest; most. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Greatest x y ⟷ (Largest x y ∧ Highest x y ∧ Most x y)"

(* Explanation 2: the amount of daylight is least in the winter. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. DaylightAmount x ∧ Winter y ⟶ Least x y"

(* Explanation 3: winter is when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. Winter x ∧ Hemisphere y ∧ Sun e ⟶ TiltedAwayFrom y e x"

(* Explanation 4: Alaska is a state located in the United States of America. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Alaska x ∧ State y ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ UnitedStatesOfAmerica y"

(* Explanation 5: United States is located in the northern hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. UnitedStates x ∧ NorthernHemisphere y ⟶ LocatedIn x y"

(* Explanation 6: the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. Earth x ∧ Axis y ⟶ CausesSeasons x"

(* Explanation 7: the amount of daylight is greatest in the summer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. DaylightAmount x ∧ Summer y ⟶ Greatest x y"

(* Explanation 8: winter is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x. Winter x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 9: summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x. Summer x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 10: amount is a property of something and includes ordered values of none; least; little; some; half; much; many; most; all. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Amount x ∧ PropertyOf x y ∧ IncludesOrderedValues y none least little some half much many most all"

(* Explanation 11: fewer means lower; less in number. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x y. Fewer x y ⟷ (Lower x y ∧ LessInNumber x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: in Alaska, there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter than in the summer. *)
  assumes asm: "Alaska x ∧ Winter y ∧ Summer z ∧ DaylightHours e1 ∧ DaylightHours e2 ∧ LessInNumber e1 e2 ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ LocatedIn x z"
  (* Hypothesis: The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  shows "∀x y e. NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Winter e ∧ TiltedAwayFrom x y e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Alaska is located in the United States of America. *)
  from asm have "Alaska x" and "LocatedIn x y" and "LocatedIn x z" apply blast
  (* From the explanation 4, we can infer that Alaska is a state located in the United States of America. *)
  then have "State y" using assms apply auto[1]
  (* Since Alaska is a state, and the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons, we can conclude that winter is a kind of season. *)
  from `Alaska x` and `State y` and explanation_4 and explanation_6 have "Winter y" using assms by auto
  (* From the premise, we have information about winter and summer. *)
  from asm have "Winter y" and "Summer z" apply blast
  (* Since winter and summer are kinds of seasons, we can infer that the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  from `Winter y` and `Summer z` and explanation_8 and explanation_9 and explanation_3 have "∀x y e. NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Winter e ∧ TiltedAwayFrom x y e" by (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
