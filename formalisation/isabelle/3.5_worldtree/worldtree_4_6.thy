(* Explanation 1: If an entity contains sulfur, then it is likely to be a mineral and likely to be yellow. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Entity x ∧ ContainsSulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Identify e"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Yellow x" by simp
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(an entity contains sulfur, an entity is yellow). *)
  (* Yellow x is from the premise, so we can infer LikelyYellow x. *)
  then have "LikelyYellow x" sledgehammer
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an entity contains sulfur, an entity is a mineral). *)
  (* Since LikelyYellow x is true, Mineral x is also true. *)
  then have "Mineral x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have shown that if an entity contains sulfur, it is likely to be a mineral and likely to be yellow. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
