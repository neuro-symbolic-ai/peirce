(* Explanation 1: An entity with learned traits is characterized by exhibiting traits that are synonymous with characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Entity x ∧ LearnedTrait x ⟶ (∃e. CharacterizedBy e ∧ Exhibiting e x ∧ SynonymousWith e x x ∧ Characteristics x)"

(* Explanation 2: Learned traits in an entity are directly linked to the traits that are synonymous with characteristics. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Entity x ∧ LearnedTrait x ⟶ (∃e. DirectlyLinked e ∧ SynonymousWith e x x ∧ Characteristics x ∧ LinkedTo e x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Entity x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∃x. Read x ∧ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have the known information about Entity x. *)
  from asm have "Entity x" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentences that relate LearnedTrait, Characteristics, and SynonymousWith. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(entity with learned traits, exhibiting traits that are synonymous with characteristics) *)
  (* We can infer that if an entity has learned traits, it exhibits traits synonymous with characteristics. *)
  (* Since being able to read is an example of a learned trait, it should be synonymous with characteristics. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an x that can Read and has LearnedTrait. *)
  then have "∃x. Read x ∧ LearnedTrait x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
