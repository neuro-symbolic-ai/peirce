(* Explanation 1: The event of leaves reflecting green light causes their green appearance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e1 e2. Reflect e1 ∧ Green (Appearance e2) ∧ Cause e1 (Appearance e2) ∧ Event e1 ∧ Event e2"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Leaves x"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light *)
 shows "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ Green x ∧ Appear e ∧ Reflect e ∧ Cause e (Green x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that leaves x. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation sentence, we have the event of leaves reflecting green light causes their green appearance. *)
  (* There exists events e1 and e2 such that Reflect e1, Green (Appearance e2), Cause e1 (Appearance e2), Event e1, and Event e2. *)
  (* We can instantiate this to our case where leaves x reflect green light and cause their green appearance. *)
  obtain e1 e2 where reflect_green: "Reflect e1" and green_appearance: "Green (Appearance e2)" and cause: "Cause e1 (Appearance e2)" and event1: "Event e1" and event2: "Event e2"
    <ATP>
  (* Since leaves x, we can assign x to Appearance e2. *)
  have "Appearance e2 = x"
    <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have Leaves x, Green x, Appear e2, Reflect e1, and Cause e1 (Green x). *)
  then have "∃x e. Leaves x ∧ Green x ∧ Appearance e ∧ Reflect e1 ∧ Cause e1 (Green x)"
    <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
