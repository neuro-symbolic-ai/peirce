(* Explanation 1: Hawaii being far from the United States mainland implies that Hawaii is a distant location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Hawaii x ∧ FarFrom x (UnitedStatesMainland x) ⟶ DistantLocation x"

(* Explanation 2: If Hawaii is a distant location, then the available types of food in Hawaii will increase as the ability to transport food increases around the world *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Hawaii x ∧ DistantLocation x ∧ Increase e ∧ Available e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ In x e ∧ TransportFood y ∧ Increase z ∧ AroundTheWorld z ⟶ Increase e ∧ Available e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ In x e"

(* Explanation 3: Therefore, the increase in available types of food in Hawaii due to improved food transportation can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃e1 e2 e3. Increase e1 ∧ Available e1 ∧ TypesOfFood e1 ∧ In x e1 ∧ Improve e2 ∧ FoodTransportation e2 ∧ Increase e3 ∧ Available e3 ∧ TypesOfFood e3 ∧ In x e3 ∧ Help e3 ∧ Agent e3 x ∧ Provide e3 ∧ VarietyOfFoodOptions e3 ∧ InStores e3"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Found e ∧ Way y ∧ KeepFresh z ∧ Foods z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transporting y ∧ LongDistances y"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃e. Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ Available e ∧ InStores e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can infer that the grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances. *)
  (* This relates to the ability to transport food increases around the world. *)
  from asm have "Transporting y ∧ LongDistances y" by meson
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, D), Implies(Hawaii being far from the United States mainland, ability to transport food increases around the world) *)
  (* Therefore, we can deduce that Hawaii is far from the United States mainland. *)
  then have "Hawaii x" sledgehammer
  (* Hawaii being far from the United States mainland implies that Hawaii is a distant location. *)
  (* This implies that the available types of food in Hawaii will increase. *)
  from `Hawaii x` and explanation_1 have "DistantLocation x" <ATP>
  from `Hawaii x` and explanation_2 have "Increase e ∧ Available e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ In x e" <ATP>
  (* The increase in available types of food in Hawaii due to improved food transportation can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores. *)
  (* This implies the hypothesis that the new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores. *)
  from `Increase e ∧ Available e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ In x e` and explanation_3 have "Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ Available e ∧ InStores e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
