(* Explanation 1: as ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. TransportAbility e1 ∧ Increase e1 ∧ World e1 ⟶ (Increase e2 ∧ FoodTypes e2 ∧ DistantLocations e2)"

(* Explanation 2: as ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e1 e2. PreserveAbility e1 ∧ Increase e1 ⟶ (Increase e2 ∧ TransportAbility e2)"

(* Explanation 3: to preserve food means to keep fresh food from spoiling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e. PreserveFood e ⟷ KeepFresh e ∧ Spoiling e"

(* Explanation 4: having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀e. VarietyFoods e ∧ Available e ⟶ PositiveImpact e ∧ PeopleLives e"

(* Explanation 5: variety means different kinds; different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x y ⟷ DifferentKinds x y ∧ DifferentTypes x y"

(* Explanation 6: helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀e. Help e ⟶ PositiveImpact e"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∃x y. Hawaii x ∧ UnitedStatesMainland y ∧ Far x y"

(* Explanation 8: far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y. Far x y ⟷ GreatDistance x y"

(* Explanation 9: distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Distant x y ⟷ GreatDistance x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ FoundWay y ∧ KeepFresh z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transporting e ∧ LongDistances e"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃e. Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ PeopleInHawaii e ∧ Increase e ∧ FoodTypes e ∧ AvailableInStores e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the grocery company, found way, keeping fresh, spoiling, transporting, and long distances. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x" and "FoundWay y" and "KeepFresh z" and "Spoiling z" and "Transporting e" and "LongDistances e" apply blast
  (* From explanatory sentence 3, we know that to preserve food means to keep fresh food from spoiling. *)
  (* This implies that keeping fresh and spoiling are related to preserving food. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer PreserveFood z. *)
  then have "PreserveFood z" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we have the relation Implies(C, A), which means that if the ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases around the world. *)
  (* Since we have PreserveFood z, we can infer Increase e. *)
  then have "Increase e" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we have the relation Implies(A, B), which means that as the ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase. *)
  (* Given Increase e, we can deduce FoodTypes e and DistantLocations e. *)
  then have "FoodTypes e" and "DistantLocations e" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* From explanatory sentence 6, we know that helping something has a positive impact on that something. *)
  (* Therefore, Help e implies PositiveImpact e. *)
  then have "Help e" and "PositiveImpact e" using assms apply auto[1]
  (* From explanatory sentence 4, we have that having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  (* Given PositiveImpact e, we can conclude VarietyFoods e and PeopleLives e. *)
  then have "VarietyFoods e" and "PeopleLives e" by (simp add: assms)
  (* Since VarietyFoods e is equivalent to variety means different kinds; different types, we can infer DifferentKinds e y and DifferentTypes e y. *)
  then have "DifferentKinds e y" and "DifferentTypes e y" sledgehammer
  (* From the premise, we know that Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland. *)
  (* This corresponds to the relation Implies(H, I), which means that if Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland, the United States of America is a kind of location. *)
  (* Therefore, we can deduce UnitedStatesAmerica x. *)
  then have "UnitedStatesAmerica x" sledgehammer
  (* Finally, combining all the derived information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
