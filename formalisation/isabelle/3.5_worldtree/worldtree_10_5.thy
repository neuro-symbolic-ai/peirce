(* Explanation 1: Shape is a property of an object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Shape x ⟶ Property x Object"

(* Explanation 2: Classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Classifying x ⟷ (Grouping y ∧ Objects y ∧ Materials y ∧ ByProperties y)"

(* Explanation 3: A leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 4: Classifying is a kind of science process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Classifying x ⟶ ScienceProcess x"

(* Explanation 5: Grouping means putting; placing in different groups. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Grouping x ⟷ (Putting y ∧ Placing y ∧ DifferentGroups y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Students are studying some leaves. *)
  assumes asm1: "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Studying x y"
  (* Premise 2: They group the leaves by shape. *)
  assumes asm2: "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Grouping x ∧ Agent x Grouping ∧ Patient x y ∧ By y Shape"
  (* Hypothesis: The students are using the science process of classifying when they put the leaves in different groups. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Student x ∧ ScienceProcess y ∧ Classifying y ∧ Leaves z ∧ Grouping e ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that students are studying leaves and grouping them by shape. *)
  from asm1 asm2 have "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Grouping e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ By e Shape" for e <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(E, B), Implies(grouping means putting; placing in different groups, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties, classifying is a kind of science process) *)
  (* Combining the above two relations, we can infer that grouping leads to classifying, which is a science process. *)
  then have "Student x ∧ ScienceProcess y ∧ Classifying y ∧ Leaves z ∧ Grouping e ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
