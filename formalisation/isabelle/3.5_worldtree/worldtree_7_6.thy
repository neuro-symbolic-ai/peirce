(* Explanation 1: An event involving reading and being able to read is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ∧ AbilityToRead x ∧ Linked e x"

(* Explanation 2: If an event involves reading and being able to read, then it is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ⟶ Linked e x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "∃x. Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that an event involves reading. *)
  from asm have "Read x" by simp
  (* There are two relevant explanation sentences: Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. *)
  (* Explanation 1 states that an event involving reading and being able to read is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that if an event involves reading and being able to read, then it is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 2 to infer that if an event involves reading, it is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
  (* Since we have Read x, we can infer AbilityToRead x. *)
  then have "AbilityToRead x" sledgehammer
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(C, B), Implies(ability to read, being able to read). *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that if someone has the ability to read, they are being able to read. *)
  then have "Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
