(* Explanation 1: shape is a property of an object *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Shape x ⟶ Property x y ∧ Object y"

(* Explanation 2: classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Classifying x ⟷ Grouping y ∧ Object z ∧ Material z ∧ ByProperty z y"

(* Explanation 3: a leaf is a kind of object *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 4: classifying is a kind of science process *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Classifying x ⟶ ScienceProcess x"

(* Explanation 5: grouping means putting; placing in different groups *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. Grouping x ⟷ Putting y ∧ Placing y ∧ InGroup z ∧ Different z"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: students are studying some leaves *)
  assumes asm1: "Student(x) ∧ Leaf(y) ∧ Studying(e) ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
  (* Premise 2: they group the leaves by shape *)
  assumes asm2: "Student(x) ∧ Leaf(y) ∧ Grouping(e) ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ ByProperty y Shape"
  (* Hypothesis: The students are using the science process of classifying when they put the leaves in different groups *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Student x ∧ Leaf y ∧ Grouping z ∧ Classifying e ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ InGroup y z"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that the students are studying leaves and grouping them by shape. *)
  from asm1 have "Student x ∧ Leaf y" <ATP>
  from asm2 have "Student x ∧ Leaf y ∧ Grouping e ∧ ByProperty y Shape" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From C, we can infer B. *)
  then have "Student x ∧ Leaf y ∧ Grouping e ∧ ByProperty y Shape" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(shape is a property of an object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From A, we can infer B. *)
  then have "Student x ∧ Leaf y ∧ Grouping e ∧ Classifying e" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(D, B), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From D, we can infer B. *)
  then have "Student x ∧ Leaf y ∧ Grouping e ∧ Classifying e ∧ Using e" <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From D, we can infer E. *)
  then have "Student x ∧ Leaf y ∧ Grouping e ∧ Classifying e ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ InGroup y z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
