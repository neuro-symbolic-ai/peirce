(* Explanation 1: Recording observations and data in a journal is a common practice in communicating the results of an investigation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal e ⟶ CommonPractice e ∧ Communicating e ∧ Agent e x y z ∧ Patient e ResultsOfInvestigation"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x y ∧ Patient e y ∧ Determine e ∧ Agent e y z ∧ RelativePH z"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal e ∧ Communicating e ∧ Agent e x y z ∧ Patient e ResultsOfInvestigation"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about Alan, cabbage juice, household solutions, using, agent, patient, determine, and relative pH. *)
  from asm have "Alan x" ∧ "CabbageJuice y" ∧ "HouseholdSolutions z" ∧ "Using e" ∧ "Agent e x y" ∧ "Patient e y" ∧ "Determine e" ∧ "Agent e y z" ∧ "RelativePH z" <ATP>
  (* The relevant information for the hypothesis is about using cabbage juice and determining the relative pH of household solutions. *)
  (* The explanation sentence 1 is not directly relevant to the hypothesis. *)
  (* We can infer that determining the relative pH of household solutions is related to communicating the results of an investigation. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  then have "Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal e ∧ Communicating e ∧ Agent e x y z ∧ Patient e ResultsOfInvestigation" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
