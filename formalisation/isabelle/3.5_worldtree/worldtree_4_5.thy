(* Explanation 1: If an entity contains sulfur, then it is likely to be a mineral *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. ContainsSulfur x y ⟶ (Mineral y ∧ LikelyMineral y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: janet has been given some minerals to identify *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given x y ∧ Identify y"
  (* Premise 2: one of her samples is yellow *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Yellow x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that if an entity contains sulfur, then it is likely to be a mineral. *)
  (* We can infer that if an entity contains sulfur, it is likely to be a mineral. *)
  (* We need to prove that sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  (* To show this, we need to prove that if something is sulfur, then it is a mineral and likely to be yellow. *)

  proof
    fix x
    (* We assume x is sulfur. *)
    assume "Sulfur x"
    (* From the explanatory sentence, we know that if an entity contains sulfur, then it is likely to be a mineral. *)
    (* Therefore, if x contains sulfur, it is likely to be a mineral. *)
    then have "Mineral x ∧ LikelyMineral x" sledgehammer
    (* Since x is sulfur, which is a mineral, we need to show that it is likely to be yellow. *)
    (* However, the information about yellow samples is not directly related to sulfur. *)
    (* We cannot directly infer that sulfur is likely to be yellow based on the given premises and explanations. *)
    (* Therefore, we cannot prove the full hypothesis with the given information. *)
    (* We have shown that if something is sulfur, it is a mineral and likely to be a mineral, but we cannot establish its color likelihood. *)
    (* Thus, the proof is inconclusive based on the provided premises and explanations. *)
