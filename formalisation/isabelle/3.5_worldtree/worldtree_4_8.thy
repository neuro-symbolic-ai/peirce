(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow and a mineral, then it is likely to be yellow. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. (Yellow x ∧ Mineral x) ⟶ LikelyYellow x"

(* Explanation 2: Yellow minerals are likely to be yellow. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Yellow x ∧ Mineral x ⟶ LikelyYellow x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given x y ∧ Identify x y"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Her y ∧ OneOf y x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Her y ∧ OneOf y x ∧ Yellow x" by meson
  (* From the explanation sentences, we have the logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), Implies(A & B, an entity is likely to be yellow) *)
  (* Yellow x and Mineral x are related to LikelyYellow x. *)
  (* We already have Yellow x, so we can infer LikelyYellow x. *)
  then have "LikelyYellow x" sledgehammer
  (* Sulfur is a mineral, so we can infer Mineral x. *)
  then have "Mineral x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
