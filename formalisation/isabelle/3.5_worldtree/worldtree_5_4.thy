(* Explanation 1: a mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers; other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e. Animal x ∧ ConsumerRole y ∧ Eats z ∧ Producer z ∧ OtherAnimals z ∧ Role x y ∧ EatsFor z x"

(* Explanation 3: green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlants x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: food is a source of energy for animals; plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ EnergySource x"

(* Explanation 5: eating; taking in food is used to get nutrients; energy by animals; living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. Eating e ⟶ GetNutrients e ∧ GetEnergy e ∧ ByAnimals e ∧ ByLivingThings e"

(* Explanation 6: living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThings x ∧ Energy y ⟶ Require x y"

(* Explanation 7: an animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThings x"

(* Explanation 8: if an organism eats something then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y z. Organism x ∧ Eats y ∧ Something z ⟶ (EatsFor x z ⟶ FoodSource z x)"

(* Explanation 9: receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀e1 e2. Receive e1 ⟷ Get e2"

(* Explanation 10: herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Herbivores x ∧ Plants y ⟶ Eat x y"

(* Explanation 11: a mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivores x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mice y ∧ Plants z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ In x y"
proof -
  (* From the known information, we have MeadowEcosystem x. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x" <ATP>
  
  (* We know that a mouse is a kind of herbivore (L) and herbivores only eat plants (K). *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that a mouse eats plants. *)
  from explanation_11 and explanation_10 have "Herbivores y ∧ Plants z ⟶ Eat y z" <ATP>
  then have "Eat y z" <ATP>
  
  (* Since eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals or living things (F), *)
  (* and if an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism (I), *)
  (* we can conclude that the plants are a source of energy for the mouse. *)
  from explanation_5 and explanation_8 have "Eating e ⟶ GetNutrients e ∧ GetEnergy e ∧ ByAnimals e ∧ ByLivingThings e" <ATP>
  from explanation_8 and `Eat y z` have "Organism y ∧ Eats z ∧ Something z ⟶ EatsFor y z ⟶ FoodSource z y" <ATP>
  then have "GetEnergy e ∧ ByAnimals e ∧ ByLivingThings e" <ATP>
  then have "FoodSource z y" <ATP>
  
  (* Since food is a source of energy for animals and plants (E), and green plants are a kind of producer (D), *)
  (* we can deduce that plants are a source of energy for the mouse. *)
  from explanation_4 and explanation_3 have "Food z ⟶ EnergySource z" <ATP>
  then have "EnergySource z" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above conclusions, we can derive that the mouse receives most of the energy it needs to survive directly from plants. *)
  then have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plants z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ In x y" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
