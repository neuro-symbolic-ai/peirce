(* Explanation 1: as ability to transport food increases around the world, the available types of food in distant locations will increase *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. TransportFood e1 ∧ Increase e1 ∧ World e1 ⟶ (TypesOfFood e2 ∧ AvailableInLocations e2 ∧ Distant e1 e2)"

(* Explanation 2: as ability to preserve food increases, the ability to transport food increases *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e1 e2. PreserveFood e1 ∧ Increase e1 ⟶ (TransportFood e2 ∧ Increase e2)"

(* Explanation 3: to preserve food means to keep fresh food from spoiling *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e. PreserveFood e ⟷ (KeepFresh e ∧ FoodSpoiling e)"

(* Explanation 4: having a variety of foods available has a positive impact on people's lives *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀e. VarietyOfFoods e ∧ Available e ⟶ (PositiveImpact e ∧ PeoplesLives e)"

(* Explanation 5: variety means different kinds; different types *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Variety x ⟷ (DifferentKinds x ∧ DifferentTypes y)"

(* Explanation 6: helping something has a positive impact on that something *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀e. Help e ⟶ (PositiveImpact e ∧ Something e)"

(* Explanation 7: Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "FarFrom Hawaii UnitedStatesMainland"

(* Explanation 8: far means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y. Far x y ⟷ GreatInDistance x y"

(* Explanation 9: distant means great in distance *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Distant x y ⟷ GreatInDistance x y"

(* Explanation 10: the United States of America is a kind of location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. UnitedStatesOfAmerica x ⟶ Location x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ FoundWay y ∧ KeepFresh z ∧ FoodSpoiling z ∧ Transporting e ∧ LongDistances e"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃e. Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e Hawaii ∧ Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ AvailableInStores e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the grocery company, found way, keeping fresh, food spoiling, transporting, and long distances. *)
  from asm have "GroceryCompany x ∧ FoundWay y ∧ KeepFresh z ∧ FoodSpoiling z ∧ Transporting e ∧ LongDistances e" <ATP>
  (* There are relevant explanatory sentences that connect the ability to preserve food, transport food, and increase types of food available. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(ability to preserve food increases, ability to transport food increases around the world) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(ability to preserve food increases, available types of food in distant locations will increase) *)
  (* Both C and D are from explanatory sentences 1, 2, and 3, we can infer an increase in types of food available. *)
  then have "Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ AvailableInStores e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(G, E), Implies(helping something, positive impact on people's lives) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(H, G), Equivalent(helping something, Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(H, E), Implies(Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland, positive impact on people's lives) *)
  (* Both G and H are from explanatory sentences 6 and 7, we can infer a positive impact on people's lives. *)
  then have "PositiveImpact e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, D), Implies(variety means different kinds; different types, having a variety of foods available) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(F, E), Implies(variety means different kinds; different types, positive impact on people's lives) *)
  (* Both F and D are from explanatory sentences 4 and 5, we can infer a variety of foods available. *)
  then have "VarietyOfFoods e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(G, I), Implies(helping something, the United States of America is a kind of location) *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(H, I), Equivalent(Hawaii is located far from the United States mainland, the United States of America is a kind of location) *)
  (* Both G and I are from explanatory sentences 6, 7, and 10, we can infer the United States of America is a kind of location. *)
  then have "UnitedStatesOfAmerica e" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above inferences, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
