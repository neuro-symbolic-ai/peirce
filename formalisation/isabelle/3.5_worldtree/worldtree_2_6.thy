(* Explanation 1: Hawaii being far from the United States mainland implies that Hawaii is a distant location *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Hawaii x ∧ FarFrom x (UnitedStatesMainland x) ⟶ DistantLocation x"

(* Explanation 2: If Hawaii is a distant location, then the available types of food in Hawaii will increase as the ability to transport food increases around the world *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Hawaii x ∧ DistantLocation x ∧ Increase e ∧ Available e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ In x (Stores x) ∧ TransportFood y ∧ Increase z ∧ AroundWorld z ⟶ Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ In x (Stores x)"

(* Explanation 3: Therefore, the increase in available types of food in Hawaii due to improved food transportation can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∃e1 e2 e3. Hawaii e1 ∧ Increase e2 ∧ Available e2 ∧ TypesOfFood e2 ∧ In e1 (Stores e2) ∧ ImprovedFoodTransportation e3 ∧ Increase e3 ∧ TypesOfFood e3 ∧ In e1 (Stores e3) ∧ Help e1 ∧ Provide e1 ∧ VarietyOfFoodOptions e1 ∧ In e1 (Stores e1)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances *)
  assumes asm: "GroceryCompany x ∧ Found e ∧ Way y ∧ KeepFreshFoods z ∧ Spoiling z ∧ Transporting y ∧ LongDistances y"
  (* Hypothesis: This new technology might help people in Hawaii by increasing the types of food available in stores *)
  shows "∃e. Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e Hawaii ∧ Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ Available e ∧ In Hawaii (Stores e)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that a grocery company found a way to keep fresh foods from spoiling when transporting them long distances. *)
  (* This information is related to the concepts of technology, help, increase in types of food, and availability of food in stores. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(Not(D), Not(A)), Implies(Not(ability to transport food increases around the world), Not(Hawaii being far from the United States mainland)) *)
  (* Since the grocery company found a way to transport food long distances, it implies that Hawaii is far from the United States mainland. *)
  (* This, in turn, implies that the ability to transport food increases around the world. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that there will be an increase in available types of food in Hawaii. *)
  (* This increase in available types of food can help people in Hawaii by providing a variety of food options in stores. *)
  then have "∃e. Technology e ∧ Help e ∧ Agent e Hawaii ∧ Increase e ∧ TypesOfFood e ∧ Available e ∧ In Hawaii (Stores e)" <ATP>
