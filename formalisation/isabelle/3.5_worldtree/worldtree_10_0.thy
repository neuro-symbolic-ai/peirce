(* Explanation 1: Shape is a property of an object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Shape x ⟶ Property x"

(* Explanation 2: Classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Classifying x ⟷ Grouping y ∧ Objects y ∧ Materials y ∧ Properties y"

(* Explanation 3: A leaf is a kind of object. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Leaf x ⟶ Object x"

(* Explanation 4: Classifying is a kind of science process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Classifying x ⟶ ScienceProcess x"

(* Explanation 5: Grouping means putting; placing in different groups. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. Grouping x ⟷ Putting y ∧ Placing y ∧ DifferentGroups y"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Students are studying some leaves. *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x y. Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Studying x y"
  (* Premise 2: They group the leaves by shape. *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x y. They x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Grouping x ∧ Patient x y ∧ ByShape y"
  (* Hypothesis: The students are using the science process of classifying when they put the leaves in different groups. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Student x ∧ ScienceProcess y ∧ Classifying y ∧ Leaves z ∧ Group z ∧ Using e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Time e z"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that students are studying leaves and grouping them by shape. *)
  from asm1 obtain x y where "Student x ∧ Leaves y ∧ Studying x y" by auto
  from asm2 obtain x' y' where "They x' ∧ Leaves y' ∧ Grouping x' ∧ Patient x' y' ∧ ByShape y'" by auto
  (* We have the logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying means grouping objects; materials by their properties) *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 3, we can infer that leaves are objects. *)
  have "Object y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(a leaf is a kind of object, classifying is a kind of science process) *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 4, we can infer that classifying is a science process. *)
  have "ScienceProcess x'" if "Classifying x'" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), Implies(classifying is a kind of science process, grouping means putting; placing in different groups) *)
  (* From the derived implication Implies(D, E), we can infer that grouping means putting leaves in different groups. *)
  have "Putting x'" if "Grouping x'" <ATP>
  have "Placing x'" if "Grouping x'" <ATP>
  have "DifferentGroups x'" if "Grouping x'" <ATP>
  (* We have all the necessary components to prove the hypothesis. *)
