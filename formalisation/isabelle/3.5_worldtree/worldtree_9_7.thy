(* Explanation 1: For many leaves to appear green, there must be a specific event where they reflect green light. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Reflect e ∧ Must e ∧ Condition e y ReflectGreenLight"

(* Explanation 2: The reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event that leads to their green appearance. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Reflect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CrucialEvent e ∧ LeadsTo e y GreenAppearance"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Leaves x ∧ Green y"
  (* Hypothesis: Many leaves appear green because they reflect green light. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Appear e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Reflect e ∧ Condition e y ReflectGreenLight"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about leaves and green color. *)
  from asm have "Leaves x ∧ Green y" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(many leaves appear green, the reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, C is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer the reflection of green light by leaves is a crucial event. *)
  then have "Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Reflect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CrucialEvent e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(there is a specific event where leaves reflect green light, leaves have a green appearance) *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 1, D is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We can infer that leaves have a green appearance. *)
  then have "Leaves x ∧ Green y ∧ Reflect e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ CrucialEvent e ∧ LeadsTo e y GreenAppearance" <ATP>
  (* We have the necessary conditions to prove the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
