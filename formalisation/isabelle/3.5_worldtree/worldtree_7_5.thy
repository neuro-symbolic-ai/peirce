(* Explanation 1: An event involving reading and being able to read is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ∧ Linked e ∧ AbilityToRead x ∧ Directly e x"

(* Explanation 2: If an event involves reading and being able to read, then it is linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ⟶ Linked e ∧ AbilityToRead x"

(* Explanation 3: If an event involves reading and being able to read, then it is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ⟶ Linked e ∧ AbilityToRead x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "∃x. Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is an event involving reading. *)
  from asm have "Read x" by simp
  (* We have three relevant explanatory sentences that link events involving reading and being able to read to the ability to read. *)
  (* We can use Explanation 1 to infer that an event involving reading and being able to read is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
  (* Since the event involves reading, it is linked to the ability to read. *)
  (* Therefore, being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain e y where "Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ∧ Linked e ∧ AbilityToRead y ∧ Directly e y" by blast
  then have "AbilityToRead y" by simp
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
