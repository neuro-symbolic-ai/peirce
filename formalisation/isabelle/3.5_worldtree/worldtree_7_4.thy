(* Explanation 1: An event involving reading and being able to read is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ∧ AbilityToRead x ∧ DirectlyLinked e x"

(* Explanation 2: If an event involves reading and being able to read, then it is linked to the ability to read. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀e x. Read e ∧ AbleToRead e ⟶ Linked e x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Read x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
 shows "∃x. Read x ⟶ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is an event involving reading. *)
  from asm have "Read x" by simp
  (* From Explanation 1, we have that an event involving reading and being able to read is directly linked to the ability to read. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(And(A, B), C), Equivalent(ability to read, A & B) *)
  (* We can infer that if an event involves reading and being able to read, it is linked to the ability to read. *)
  then have "∃x. Linked x (AbilityToRead x)" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(ability to read, being able to read) *)
  (* Since ability to read implies being able to read, we can conclude that being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
