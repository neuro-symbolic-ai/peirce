(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers or other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z e1 e2. Animal x ∧ Role y ∧ Consumer y ∧ Eat e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Producer z ∨ Animal z ∧ Food e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 z"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlant x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals and plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (EnergySource x ∧ Animal x ∨ Plant x)"

(* Explanation 5: Eating or taking in food is used to get nutrients and energy by animals or living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. Eat e ∨ TakeInFood e ⟶ (Get e Nutrients ∧ Get e Energy ∧ Animal (Agent e) ∨ LivingThing (Agent e))"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. Organism x ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ (Food y ⟶ SourceOfFood y x)"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ∧ Get y ⟶ Means x y"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. Herbivore x ⟶ (∀y. Plant y ⟶ Eat x y)"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Require y z ∧ Survival y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are in a meadow ecosystem, there is a mouse, and there is a plant. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z" <ATP>
  (* Since a mouse is a kind of herbivore (L), and herbivores only eat plants (K), we can infer that the mouse eats plants. *)
  from explanation_11 and explanation_10 have "Herbivore y" and "Plant z ⟶ Eat y z" <ATP>
  (* From the fact that an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism (I), and the mouse eats the plant, we can conclude that the plant is a source of food for the mouse. *)
  from explanation_8 and calculation have "Food z ⟶ SourceOfFood z y" <ATP>
  (* Since food is a source of energy for animals and plants (E), and the mouse receives most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants, we can deduce that the mouse receives energy from the plant. *)
  from calculation and explanation_4 have "EnergySource z" <ATP>
  (* Living things all require energy for survival (G), and the mouse receives energy from the plant, so the mouse can survive. *)
  from calculation and explanation_6 have "Require y z ∧ Survival y" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the elements, we have shown that in a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
