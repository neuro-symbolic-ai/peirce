(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow in color, then it is likely to contain sulfur *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Entity x ∧ YellowColor x ⟶ LikelyContainSulfur x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity contains sulfur, then it is a mineral *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Entity x ∧ ContainsSulfur x ⟶ Mineral x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ IdentifyPurpose e"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ YellowColor x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ YellowColor x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(an entity is yellow in color, an entity is likely to contain sulfur) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have YellowColor x, so we can infer LikelyContainSulfur x. *)
  then have "Sample x ∧ YellowColor x ∧ LikelyContainSulfur x" sledgehammer
  (* From the explanation 1, we can deduce that LikelyContainSulfur x implies ContainsSulfur x. *)
  then have "Sample x ∧ YellowColor x ∧ ContainsSulfur x" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation 2, we can deduce that ContainsSulfur x implies Mineral x. *)
  then have "Sample x ∧ YellowColor x ∧ ContainsSulfur x ∧ Mineral x" <ATP>
  (* We need to show that Sulfur x implies (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x). *)
  (* Since ContainsSulfur x implies Mineral x, we can infer Sulfur x implies Mineral x. *)
  then have "Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
