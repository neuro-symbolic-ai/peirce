(* Explanation 1: Determining the relative pH of substances is a crucial step in conducting investigations and communicating the outcomes effectively. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Determining x ∧ RelativepH y ∧ Substances z ∧ CrucialStep e ∧ ConductingInvestigations e ∧ CommunicatingOutcomes e ∧ Agent e x y z"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ RelativepH e ∧ Agent e x y z"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data z ∧ Journal e ∧ Communicates e ∧ Agent e x y z ResultsOfInvestigation"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about Alan, cabbage juice, household solutions, determine, relative pH, and agent. *)
  from asm have "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ RelativepH e ∧ Agent e x y z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(determining the relative pH of substances, conducting investigations) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have RelativepH e, so we can infer ConductingInvestigations e. *)
  then have "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ RelativePHe e ∧ ConductingInvestigations e ∧ Agent e x y z" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(determining the relative pH of substances, communicating the outcomes effectively) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, C is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have RelativepH e, so we can infer CommunicatingOutcomes e. *)
  then have "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ RelativePHe e ∧ CommunicatingOutcomes e ∧ Agent e x y z" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis involves recording, observations, data, journal, communicates, and agent. *)
  (* We can combine the extracted information with the inferred information to satisfy the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
