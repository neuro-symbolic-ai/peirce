(* Explanation 1: greatest means largest; highest; most. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Greatest x y ⟷ (Largest x y ∧ Highest x y ∧ Most x y)"

(* Explanation 2: the amount of daylight is least in the winter. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. DaylightAmount x ∧ Winter y ⟶ Least x y"

(* Explanation 3: winter is when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. Winter x ∧ Hemisphere y ∧ Sun z ⟶ (TiltedAway e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e e ∧ TimeOf e x)"

(* Explanation 4: Alaska is a state located in the United States of America. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Alaska x ∧ State y ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ UnitedStatesOfAmerica y"

(* Explanation 5: United States is located in the northern hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. UnitedStates x ∧ NorthernHemisphere y ∧ LocatedIn x y"

(* Explanation 6: the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e. Earth x ∧ Axis y ∧ Tilted e ∧ On x y ⟶ Causes e Season"

(* Explanation 7: the amount of daylight is greatest in the summer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. DaylightAmount x ∧ Summer y ⟶ Greatest x y"

(* Explanation 8: winter is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x. Winter x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 9: summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x. Summer x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 10: amount is a property of something and includes ordered values of none; least; little; some; half; much; many; most; all. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Amount x ∧ PropertyOf x y ∧ Includes y None ∧ Includes y Least ∧ Includes y Little ∧ Includes y Some ∧ Includes y Half ∧ Includes y Much ∧ Includes y Many ∧ Includes y Most ∧ Includes y All"

(* Explanation 11: fewer means lower; less in number. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x y. Fewer x y ⟷ (Lower x y ∧ LessInNumber x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: in Alaska, there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter than in the summer. *)
  assumes asm: "Alaska x ∧ Winter y ∧ Summer z ∧ DaylightAmount e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ Fewer y e ∧ Fewer z e"
  (* Hypothesis: The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  shows "∀x y z e. NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Winter z ∧ TiltedAway e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TimeOf e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the known information about Alaska, winter, summer, daylight amount, agent, and patient. *)
  from asm have "Alaska x" and "Winter y" and "Summer z" and "DaylightAmount e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" and "Patient e z" and "Fewer y e" and "Fewer z e" <ATP>
  
  (* We know that the amount of daylight is least in the winter, which implies that winter is a kind of season. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "Winter y ⟶ Season y" <ATP>
  
  (* Since winter is a kind of season, and the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons, we can infer that winter is when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. *)
  from explanation_8 and explanation_6 have "Winter y ⟶ Causes e Season" <ATP>
  from asm and this have "Winter y ⟶ TiltedAway e" <ATP>
  
  (* Alaska is a state located in the United States of America, and United States is located in the northern hemisphere. *)
  from explanation_4 and explanation_5 have "Alaska x ⟶ NorthernHemisphere y" <ATP>
  
  (* Combining the above information, we can conclude that the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
