(* Explanation 1: A pulley is used to lift a flag on a flagpole. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Pulley x ∧ Flag y ∧ Flagpole z ∧ Lift e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ On y z"

(* Explanation 2: A pulley is a kind of simple machine. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Pulley x ⟶ SimpleMachine x"

(* Explanation 3: To lift means to move up. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Lift x ⟷ MoveUp y"


theorem hypothesis:
 assumes asm: "Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e"
  (* Hypothesis: A pulley is a simple machine that helps move a flag up a flagpole. *)
 shows "∃x y z e. Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e ∧ Helps e ∧ Move e ∧ Up e ∧ On z e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the pulley, simple machine, flag, and flagpole. *)
  from asm have "Pulley x" and "SimpleMachine y" and "Flag z" and "Flagpole e" apply simp
  
  (* We know that a pulley is a kind of simple machine from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, B), Implies(to lift means to move up, a pulley is a kind of simple machine) *)
  (* We can infer that the pulley being a simple machine. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "SimpleMachine x" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* We also know that to lift means to move up from explanatory sentence 3. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, A), Implies(to lift means to move up, a pulley is used to lift a flag on a flagpole) *)
  (* We can infer that a pulley is used to lift a flag on a flagpole. *)
  from explanation_3 and asm have "Lift x" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* Combining the above information, we can derive the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Pulley x ∧ SimpleMachine y ∧ Flag z ∧ Flagpole e ∧ Helps e ∧ Move e ∧ Up e ∧ On z e" using assms by presburger
