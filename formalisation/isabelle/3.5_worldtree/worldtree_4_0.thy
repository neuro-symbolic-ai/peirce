(* Explanation 1: Sulfur is yellow in color. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ YellowColor x"

(* Explanation 2: Sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify. *)
  assumes asm: "Janet x ∧ Minerals y ∧ Given e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ IdentifyPurpose e"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow. *)
  assumes asm: "Sample x ∧ Janet y ∧ Her y ∧ YellowColor x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow. *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that one of Janet's samples is yellow. *)
  from asm have "Sample x ∧ Janet y ∧ Her y ∧ YellowColor x" by simp
  (* We have the explanatory sentence that sulfur is yellow in color. *)
  (* There is no direct logical relation or implication provided. *)
  (* However, we can use the information that sulfur is yellow to infer that the yellow sample could be sulfur. *)
  have "YellowColor x ⟶ Sulfur x" by (simp add: explanation_1) sledgehammer
  (* We also have the explanatory sentence that sulfur is a kind of mineral. *)
  have "Sulfur x ⟶ Mineral x" by (simp add: explanation_2) sledgehammer
  (* Combining the above two implications, we can conclude that the yellow sample is likely sulfur, which is a mineral. *)
  then have "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
