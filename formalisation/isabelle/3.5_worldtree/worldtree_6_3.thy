(* Explanation 1: greatest means largest; highest; most. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Greatest x y ⟷ (Largest x y ∧ Highest x y ∧ Most x y)"

(* Explanation 2: the amount of daylight is least in the winter. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. DaylightAmount x ∧ Winter y ⟶ Least x y"

(* Explanation 3: winter is when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. Winter x ∧ Hemisphere y ∧ Sun z ⟶ (TiltedAway e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ TimeOf e x)"

(* Explanation 4: Alaska is a state located in the United States of America. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Alaska x ∧ State y ∧ LocatedIn x y ∧ UnitedStatesOfAmerica y"

(* Explanation 5: United States is located in the northern hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y. UnitedStates x ∧ NorthernHemisphere y ⟶ LocatedIn x y"

(* Explanation 6: the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y e. Earth x ∧ Axis y ∧ Tilted e ∧ Cause e ∧ Patient e Seasons"

(* Explanation 7: the amount of daylight is greatest in the summer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x y. DaylightAmount x ∧ Summer y ⟶ Greatest x y"

(* Explanation 8: winter is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x. Winter x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 9: summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x. Summer x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 10: amount is a property of something and includes ordered values of none; least; little; some; half; much; many; most; all. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x y. Amount x ∧ PropertyOf x y ∧ Includes y None ∧ Includes y Least ∧ Includes y Little ∧ Includes y Some ∧ Includes y Half ∧ Includes y Much ∧ Includes y Many ∧ Includes y Most ∧ Includes y All"

(* Explanation 11: fewer means lower; less in number. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x y. Fewer x y ⟷ (Lower x y ∧ LessInNumber x y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: in Alaska, there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter than in the summer. *)
  assumes asm: "Alaska x ∧ DaylightAmount y ∧ Winter z ∧ Summer w ∧ Fewer e z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Patient e w"
  (* Hypothesis: The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter. *)
  shows "∀x y z e. NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Winter z ∧ TiltedAway e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TimeOf e z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the known information about Alaska, daylight amount, winter, summer, and fewer hours in winter. *)
  from asm have "Alaska x" and "DaylightAmount y" and "Winter z" and "Summer w" and "Fewer e z" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e y" and "Patient e w" <ATP>
  
  (* We know that winter is a kind of season from explanatory sentence 8. *)
  from asm have "Winter z ⟶ Season z" <ATP>
  
  (* Since winter is a kind of season, we can infer that the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons from explanatory sentence 6. *)
  from asm and explanation_8 have "Season z ⟶ the Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons" <ATP>
  
  (* The Earth being tilted on its axis causes seasons implies that the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun in the winter from the logical relation Implies(C, F). *)
  from asm and explanation_6 have "NorthernHemisphere x ∧ Sun y ∧ Winter z ∧ TiltedAway e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TimeOf e z" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
