(* Explanation 1: Recording observations and data in a journal is a common practice in communicating the results of an investigation. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data y ∧ Journal y ⟶ CommonPractice x ∧ (∃e. Communicating e ResultsOfInvestigation)"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. *)
  assumes asm: "Alan x ∧ CabbageJuice y ∧ HouseholdSolutions z ∧ Determine e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e RelativePH"
  (* Hypothesis: Recording observations and data in a journal communicates the results of an investigation. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data y ∧ Journal y ∧ Communicating e ResultsOfInvestigation ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e ResultsOfInvestigation"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can see that Alan is the agent of the event of determining the relative pH. *)
  (* We also know that the patient of this event is the relative pH of household solutions using cabbage juice. *)
  (* These are not directly related to the hypothesis, so we need to focus on the relevant explanatory sentence. *)
  
  (* Explanation 1 states that recording observations and data in a journal is a common practice in communicating the results of an investigation. *)
  (* This implies that if recording, observations, data, and journal are involved, it is a common practice to communicate the results of an investigation. *)
  (* Given the premise, we can see that we have elements related to recording, observations, data, and journal. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer the hypothesis based on this explanatory sentence. *)
  
  from asm have "Alan x" and "CabbageJuice y" and "HouseholdSolutions z" and "Determine e" <ATP>
  then have "∃e. Communicating e ResultsOfInvestigation" <ATP>
  then have "∃x y e. Recording x ∧ Observations y ∧ Data y ∧ Journal y ∧ Communicating e ResultsOfInvestigation ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e ResultsOfInvestigation" <ATP>
  
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
