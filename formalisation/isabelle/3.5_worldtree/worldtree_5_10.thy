(* Explanation 1: A mouse is a kind of animal. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Animal x"

(* Explanation 2: In the food chain process, an animal has the role of consumer which eats producers; other animals for food. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. Animal x ∧ Role y ∧ Consumer y ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Producer z ∧ FoodFor z x"

(* Explanation 3: Green plants are a kind of producer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. GreenPlant x ⟶ Producer x"

(* Explanation 4: Food is a source of energy for animals; plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Food x ⟶ (SourceOfEnergy x ∧ (Animal x ∨ Plant x))"

(* Explanation 5: Eating; taking in food is used to get nutrients; energy by animals; living things. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀e. (Eating e ∨ TakingInFood e) ⟶ (UsedFor e Nutrients ∧ UsedFor e Energy ∧ (Animal (Agent e) ∨ LivingThing (Agent e)))"

(* Explanation 6: Living things all require energy for survival. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y. LivingThing x ∧ Energy y ⟶ Require x y ∧ Purpose y Survival"

(* Explanation 7: An animal is a kind of living thing. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_7: "∀x. Animal x ⟶ LivingThing x"

(* Explanation 8: If an organism eats something, then that something is a source of food to that organism. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_8: "∀x y e. Organism x ∧ Eat e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ⟶ (Food y ⟶ SourceOfFood y x)"

(* Explanation 9: Receive means get. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_9: "∀x y. Receive x ⟷ Get y"

(* Explanation 10: Herbivores only eat plants. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_10: "∀x. Herbivore x ⟶ Eat x Plant"

(* Explanation 11: A mouse is a kind of herbivore. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_11: "∀x. Mouse x ⟶ Herbivore x"


theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z"
  (* Hypothesis: In a meadow ecosystem, mice receive most of the energy they need to survive directly from plants. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z ∧ Energy e ∧ Receive e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Patient e z ∧ DirectlyFrom z x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that we are dealing with a meadow ecosystem, a mouse, and a plant. *)
  from asm have "MeadowEcosystem x ∧ Mouse y ∧ Plant z" <ATP>
  (* Since a mouse is a kind of herbivore, and herbivores only eat plants, we can infer that the mouse eats the plant. *)
  from explanation_11 and explanation_10 have "Eat y z" <ATP>
  (* As food is a source of energy for animals and plants, and the mouse is an animal, the plant provides energy to the mouse. *)
  from explanation_4 and explanation_1 have "SourceOfEnergy z" <ATP>
  (* Since receiving means getting, the mouse receives energy from the plant. *)
  from explanation_9 have "Receive e" <ATP>
  (* The mouse is the agent of receiving energy from the plant. *)
  from asm have "Agent e y" <ATP>
  (* The plant is the patient, providing energy to the mouse. *)
  from asm have "Patient e z" <ATP>
  (* The energy received is directly from the plant in the meadow ecosystem. *)
  from asm have "DirectlyFrom z x" <ATP>
  (* Combining all the above information, we have the required conclusion. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
