(* Explanation 1: If an entity is yellow in color, then it is likely to contain sulfur *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Yellow x ⟶ LikelyContainSulfur x"

(* Explanation 2: If an entity is yellow in color and likely to contain sulfur, then it contains sulfur *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. (Yellow x ∧ LikelyContainSulfur x) ⟶ ContainSulfur x"

(* Explanation 3: If an entity is yellow in color, likely to contain sulfur, and contains sulfur, then it is a mineral *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. (Yellow x ∧ LikelyContainSulfur x ∧ ContainSulfur x) ⟶ Mineral x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Janet has been given some minerals to identify *)
  assumes asm1: "∃x. Janet x ∧ (∃y. Given x y ∧ Minerals y)"
  (* Premise 2: One of her samples is yellow *)
  assumes asm2: "∃x. Sample x ∧ Yellow x"
  (* Hypothesis: Sulfur is a mineral that is likely to be yellow *)
  shows "∀x. Sulfur x ⟶ (Mineral x ∧ LikelyYellow x)"
proof -
  (* From the premises, we know that Janet has been given some minerals to identify and one of her samples is yellow. *)
  obtain x y where xy: "Janet x ∧ Given x y ∧ Minerals y" using asm1 by blast
  obtain z where z: "Sample z ∧ Yellow z" sledgehammer
  (* From Explanation 1, if an entity is yellow, then it is likely to contain sulfur. *)
  from z have "Yellow z ⟶ LikelyContainSulfur z" by (rule explanation_1)
  (* From Explanation 2, if an entity is yellow and likely to contain sulfur, then it contains sulfur. *)
  from z and this have "Yellow z ∧ LikelyContainSulfur z ⟶ ContainSulfur z" by (rule explanation_2)
  (* From Explanation 3, if an entity is yellow, likely to contain sulfur, and contains sulfur, then it is a mineral. *)
  from z and this and xy have "Yellow z ∧ LikelyContainSulfur z ∧ ContainSulfur z ⟶ Mineral z" by (rule explanation_3)
  (* We know that sulfur is an entity that contains sulfur. *)
  have "Sulfur z ⟶ (Mineral z ∧ LikelyYellow z)" by auto
  then show ?thesis by auto
