(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album, and a photo album is a type of book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1a: "∃x y e. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y" and
  explanation_1b: "∀x. PhotoAlbum x ⟶ Book x"

(* Explanation 2: If someone is looking through a photo album, then there is a book involved because a photo album is a type of book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2a: "∀x y e. (Someone x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y) ⟶ (∃z. Book z ∧ Involved z)" and
  explanation_2b: "∀x. PhotoAlbum x ⟶ Book x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ BlackFramed y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Wicker w ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Sitting e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ In x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about a woman and a photo album. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z" by meson
  (* Explanation 1b states that a photo album is a type of book. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that z is a book. *)
  then have "Book z" using explanation_2b by presburger
  (* We need to show that there is a lady with a book. *)
  (* Since we have Woman x and Book z, we can infer Lady x and Book z. *)
  then have "Lady x ∧ Book z" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that there is a lady with a book, which implies the existence of such entities. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
