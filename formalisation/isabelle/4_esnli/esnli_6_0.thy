(* Explanation 1: Seven men are looking in a train. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Men x ∧ Seven x ∧ Train y ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: Seven men wearing bright orange reflective vests are looking inside the door of a red train. *)
  assumes asm: "Men x ∧ Seven x ∧ Vests y ∧ Bright y ∧ Orange y ∧ Reflective y ∧ Train z ∧ Red z ∧ Door w ∧ Of w z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Inside x w ∧ Wearing x y"
  (* Hypothesis: A group of men are looking in a train. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Group x ∧ Men y ∧ Train z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In x z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about seven men looking inside the door of a red train. *)
  from asm have "Men x ∧ Seven x ∧ Train z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x" by meson
  (* Explanation 1 states that seven men are looking in a train. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that the men are looking in the train. *)
  then have "In x z" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show that a group of men are looking in a train. *)
  (* Since seven men can be considered a group, we can infer the hypothesis. *)
  then have "Group x ∧ Men x ∧ Train z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In x z" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
