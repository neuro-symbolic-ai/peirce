(* Explanation 1: If the people are near the stand and the stand is small, they are likely outside it. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. (People x ∧ Stand y ∧ Near x y ∧ Small y) ⟶ LikelyOutside x y"

(* Explanation 2: If people are standing near a small stand, they are typically outside the stand. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. (People x ∧ Stand y ∧ Small y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Near x y) ⟶ TypicallyOutside x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A small ice cream stand with two people standing near it. *)
  assumes asm: "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Near y x"
  (* Hypothesis: Two people standing outside an ice cream stand. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. People x ∧ IceCreamStand y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Outside x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the ice cream stand, its size, the people, and their location. *)
  from asm have "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Near y x" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(A, B), C), which states that if the people are near the stand and the stand is small, they are outside the stand. *)
  (* A is the people are near the stand, B is the stand is small, and C is they are outside the stand. *)
  (* We already have People y, Small x, and Near y x, so we can infer LikelyOutside y x. *)
  then have "LikelyOutside y x" sledgehammer
  (* Since LikelyOutside implies that the people are outside the stand, we can conclude that the people are standing outside the ice cream stand. *)
  then have "Outside y x" <ATP>
  (* We need to show the existence of such entities and event. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
