(* Explanation 1: The man is on a dirty sidewalk. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Man x ∧ Sidewalk y ∧ Dirty y ∧ On x y"

(* Explanation 2: Sidewalks are found outdoors. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Sidewalk x ⟶ FoundOutdoors x"

(* Explanation 3: If a man is on a sidewalk and sidewalks are outdoors, then the man is outside. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. (Man x ∧ Sidewalk y ∧ On x y ∧ FoundOutdoors y) ⟶ Outside x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A old man sells hardware parts on a dirty sidewalk. *)
  assumes asm: "OldMan x ∧ HardwareParts y ∧ Sidewalk z ∧ Dirty z ∧ Sells e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ On x z"
  (* Hypothesis: The man is outside. *)
  shows "∀x. Man x ⟶ Outside x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the old man, hardware parts, sidewalk, and the event of selling. *)
  from asm have "OldMan x ∧ Sidewalk z ∧ Dirty z ∧ On x z" by simp
  (* Explanation 1 states that the man is on a dirty sidewalk. *)
  (* Explanation 2 states that sidewalks are found outdoors. *)
  from explanation_2 have "Sidewalk z ⟶ FoundOutdoors z" by auto
  (* Since we have Sidewalk z, we can infer FoundOutdoors z. *)
  from `Sidewalk z` and `Sidewalk z ⟶ FoundOutdoors z` have "FoundOutdoors z" by (simp add: \<open>Sidewalk z \<longrightarrow> FoundOutdoors z\<close> assms)
  (* Explanation 3 provides the logical relation: If a man is on a sidewalk and sidewalks are outdoors, then the man is outside. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∀x y. (Man x ∧ Sidewalk y ∧ On x y ∧ FoundOutdoors y) ⟶ Outside x" by blast
  (* We have OldMan x, which implies Man x. *)
  from `OldMan x` have "Man x" sledgehammer
  (* Now we have Man x, Sidewalk z, On x z, and FoundOutdoors z. *)
  (* We can apply the logical relation from explanation 3 to infer that the man is outside. *)
  from `Man x` and `Sidewalk z` and `On x z` and `FoundOutdoors z` have "Outside x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
