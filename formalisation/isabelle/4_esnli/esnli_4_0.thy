(* Explanation 1: If the people are near the stand they are outside it. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. People x ∧ Stand y ∧ Near x y ⟶ Outside x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A small ice cream stand with two people standing near it *)
  assumes asm: "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Near y x"
  (* Hypothesis: Two people standing outside an ice cream stand *)
  shows "∃x y z e. People x ∧ IceCreamStand y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Outside x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about the ice cream stand, people, and their positions. *)
  from asm have "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Near y x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(the people are near the stand, the people are outside the stand) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have Near y x, so we can infer Outside y x. *)
  then have "People y ∧ IceCreamStand x ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Outside y x" sledgehammer
