(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album which is a type of book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y ∧ TypeOf y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ BlackFramed y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Wicker w ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Sitting e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ In x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about a woman, glasses, and a photo album. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z" by blast
  (* Explanation 1 provides a logical relation that a photo album is a type of book. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that there is a book. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃x y z e. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y ∧ TypeOf y z" by meson
  (* Since we have a photo album, we can infer there is a book. *)
  then have "Book z" sledgehammer
  (* We also know from the premise that the agent is a woman, which can be inferred to be a lady. *)
  then have "Lady x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude there is a lady with a book. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
