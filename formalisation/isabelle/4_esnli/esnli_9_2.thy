(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album, and a photo album is a type of book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y ∧ (PhotoAlbum y ⟶ Book y)"

(* Explanation 2: If someone is looking through a photo album, then there is a book involved because a photo album is a type of book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. (Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Through e y ∧ (PhotoAlbum y ⟶ Book y)) ⟶ (∃z. Book z ∧ Involved z)"

(* Explanation 3: A woman can be referred to as a lady *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. Woman x ⟶ Lady x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ BlackFramed y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Wicker w ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Sitting e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ In x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the woman, photo album, and the action of perusing. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z" by fastforce
  (* Using Explanation 3, we know that a woman can be referred to as a lady. *)
  from explanation_3 and `Woman x` have "Lady x" by (simp add: assms explanation_3)
  (* Explanation 2 states that if someone is looking through a photo album, then there is a book involved. *)
  (* Since Peruses e1 is similar to Looking e, we can apply Explanation 2. *)
  from explanation_2 and `Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Patient e1 z` have "∃y. Book y ∧ Involved y" using explanation_1 explanation_2 by force
  (* We have Lady x and ∃y. Book y, which implies there is a lady with a book. *)
  then obtain y where "Book y ∧ Involved y" by blast
  then have "Lady x ∧ Book y" using \<open>Lady x\<close> by auto
