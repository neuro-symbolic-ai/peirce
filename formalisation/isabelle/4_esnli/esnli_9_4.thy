(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album, and the specific photo album she is looking through is a type of book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e1. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Through e1 y ∧ (y = z)"

(* Explanation 2: Perusing a photo album inherently involves interacting with a book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e1 e2. PhotoAlbum x ∧ Book y ∧ Perusing e1 ∧ Interacting e2 ∧ Involves e1 e2 ∧ Patient e2 y"

(* Explanation 3: A woman becomes a lady when she is engaged in an activity such as perusing a photo album, and perusing a photo album is an activity that involves looking through a book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3. Woman x ∧ Lady y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Perusing e1 ∧ Activity e2 ∧ Looking e3 ∧ Involves e2 e3 ∧ Through e3 z ⟶ (Engaged e1 x ∧ Becomes x y)"

(* Explanation 4: A woman is considered a lady when she is actively engaged in an intellectual or cultural activity, such as perusing a photo album, which involves a book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z e1 e2 e3. Woman x ∧ Lady y ∧ Activity e1 ∧ Intellectual e1 ∧ Cultural e1 ∧ Perusing e2 ∧ Book z ∧ Involves e1 e2 ∧ Engaged e3 x ⟶ Considered x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Perusing e1 ∧ Sitting e2 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In x y ∧ In w y"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have information about a woman perusing a photo album. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Perusing e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z" by blast
  (* Explanation 3 states that a woman becomes a lady when engaged in an activity such as perusing a photo album. *)
  (* This involves looking through a book, which is part of the activity. *)
  from explanation_3 have "∀x y z e1 e2 e3. Woman x ∧ Lady y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Perusing e1 ∧ Activity e2 ∧ Looking e3 ∧ Involves e2 e3 ∧ Through e3 z ⟶ (Engaged e1 x ∧ Becomes x y)" by blast
  (* Since the woman is perusing a photo album, she is engaged in the activity. *)
  then have "Engaged e1 x ∧ Becomes x y" sledgehammer
  (* From the derived implications, we know that perusing a photo album implies interacting with a book. *)
  from explanation_2 have "∀x y e1 e2. PhotoAlbum x ∧ Book y ∧ Perusing e1 ∧ Interacting e2 ∧ Involves e1 e2 ∧ Patient e2 y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, there exists a book that the lady is interacting with. *)
  then have "∃y. Book y ∧ Interacting e2 ∧ Patient e2 y" <ATP>
  (* Combining these, we can conclude that there is a lady with a book. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
