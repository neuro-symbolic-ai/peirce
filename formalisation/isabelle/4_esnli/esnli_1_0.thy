(* Explanation 1: If the infant is crying, it can be assumed that they are unhappy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Infant x ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x ⟶ Unhappy x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib y ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy. *)
  shows "∃x. Baby x ∧ Unhappy x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the infant, crib, crying, agent, and location. *)
  from asm have "Infant x ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(the infant is crying, the infant is unhappy) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We already have Infant x, Crying e, and Agent e x, so we can infer Unhappy x. *)
  then have "Unhappy x" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* We need to show that a baby is unhappy. Since an infant is a baby, we can infer Baby x. *)
  then have "Baby x" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there exists an x such that Baby x and Unhappy x. *)
