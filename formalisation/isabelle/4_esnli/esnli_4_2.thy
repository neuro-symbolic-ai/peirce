(* Explanation 1: If people are near a small stand, they are outside the stand. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. People x ∧ SmallStand y ∧ Near x y ⟶ Outside x y"

(* Explanation 2: If people are standing near a small stand, they are outside the stand. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. People x ∧ SmallStand y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Near x y ⟶ Outside x y"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A small ice cream stand with two people standing near it *)
  assumes asm: "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Near y x"
  (* Hypothesis: Two people standing outside an ice cream stand *)
  shows "∃x y z e. People x ∧ IceCreamStand y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Outside x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have known information about the ice cream stand, people, standing, agent, and near relation. *)
  from asm have "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Standing e ∧ Agent e y ∧ Near y x" by auto
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(C, D), Implies(people are standing near a small stand, people are outside the stand) *)
  (* C is from explanatory sentence 2, D is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have People y, Small x, Standing e, Agent e y, and Near y x, so we can infer Outside y x. *)
  then have "Outside y x" sledgehammer
  (* We need to show the existence of such entities and event. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
