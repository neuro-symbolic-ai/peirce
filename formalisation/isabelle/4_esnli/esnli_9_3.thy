(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album, and a photo album is a type of book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y ∧ (PhotoAlbum y ⟶ Book y)"

(* Explanation 2: Therefore, if a lady is looking through a photo album, she is with a book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. (Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Through e y) ⟶ With x z"

(* Explanation 3: If someone is looking through a photo album, then there is a book involved because a photo album is a type of book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y z e. (Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Through e y ∧ Book z ∧ (PhotoAlbum y ⟶ Book y)) ⟶ Involved z"

(* Explanation 4: This implies that the person is with the book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. (Person x ∧ Book y) ⟶ With x y"

(* Explanation 5: A woman can be referred to as a lady *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x. Woman x ⟶ Lady x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ BlackFramed y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ Sitting e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ In x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
  using explanation_1 explanation_2 by blast
