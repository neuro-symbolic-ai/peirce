(* Explanation 1: If the people are near the stand they are outside it *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. People x ∧ People y ∧ Stand e ∧ Near x e ⟶ Outside y e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A small ice cream stand with two people standing near it *)
  assumes asm: "IceCreamStand x ∧ Small x ∧ People y ∧ Two y ∧ Standing e ∧ Near y x"
  (* Hypothesis: Two people standing outside an ice cream stand *)
  shows "∃x y e. People x ∧ People y ∧ Stand e ∧ IceCreamStand e ∧ Standing e ∧ Outside y e ∧ At x e ∧ At y e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is an ice cream stand, people, and their proximity. *)
  from asm have "IceCreamStand x ∧ People y ∧ Near y x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition Implies(A, B), Implies(the people are near the stand, the people are outside the stand) *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentence 1 to infer that if people are near the stand, they are outside it. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the people are outside the stand. *)
  then have "Outside y e" for e <ATP>
  (* We can now derive the hypothesis based on the given information. *)
  then have "∃x y e. People x ∧ People y ∧ Stand e ∧ IceCreamStand e ∧ Standing e ∧ Outside y e ∧ At x e ∧ At y e" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
