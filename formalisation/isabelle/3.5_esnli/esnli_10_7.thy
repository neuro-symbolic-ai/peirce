(* Explanation 1: In red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Red x ∧ Makeup x ⟶ Type x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A festival displays two men dressed in red makeup and costume, while an older man has cream on his face. *)
  assumes asm: "Festival x ∧ Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Red ∧ In z Costume ∧ Display e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ Contrast e2 ∧ OlderMan z ∧ HasCream e2 ∧ Agent e2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: Two men are dressed in makeup. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Man x ∧ Man y ∧ Dressed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ In x Makeup"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the men, dressed event, agents, and the makeup and costume they are in. *)
  from asm have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Red ∧ In z Costume" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentence 1 stating that red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
  (* Since the men are in red makeup, we can infer that they are dressed in makeup. *)
  then have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Makeup ∧ In z Makeup" <ATP>
  (* We can combine the information to show that two men are dressed in makeup. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
