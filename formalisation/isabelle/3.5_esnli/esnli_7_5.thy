(* Explanation 1: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner, where the action of directing is a part of the process of herding in the context of an event. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ PartOf e Herding ∧ Involves e Directing ∧ Specific e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through the specific action of directing them, which is a crucial aspect of the herding process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ Involvement e y ∧ Manifested e ∧ CrucialAspect e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ AdverbialModifier e z"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the policeman, crowd of people, walking, and directing. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition B: Directing pedestrians in a specific manner. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we know that Directing is part of the process of Herding. *)
  (* Since Directing e is part of Herding e, we can infer Herding e. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical proposition C: Presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we know that Involvement e y is manifested and is a crucial aspect of the herding process. *)
  (* Since Involvement e y is manifested and a crucial aspect, we can infer Pedestrians y. *)
  then have "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
