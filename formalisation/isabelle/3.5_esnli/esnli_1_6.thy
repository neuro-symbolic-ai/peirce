(* Explanation 1: Experiencing distress is a result of the specific situation where the infant is in a crib and crying. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2 x. Distress e1 ∧ Result e2 ∧ SpecificSituation x ∧ InCrib e2 x ∧ Crying e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ⟶ Experiencing e1 ∧ Patient e1 x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib e ∧ InCrib e x ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy. *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can derive that the infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  from asm have "Infant x ∧ Crib e ∧ Crying e" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(B, C), A), Implies(B & C, experiencing distress) *)
  (* We have B and C, which implies A. *)
  (* As per the explanation sentence, experiencing distress is a result of the specific situation where the infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the infant is experiencing distress. *)
  then have "Experiencing e1" for some e1 where "Patient e1 x" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis states that a baby is unhappy. *)
  (* Unhappy is a result of experiencing distress. *)
  (* Hence, we can conclude that the baby is unhappy. *)
  then have "Baby x ∧ Unhappy e1 ∧ Agent e1 x" for some e1 sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
