(* Explanation 1: The lady possesses the book she is associated with, and this association implies that the lady has the book in her possession. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ Possesses x y ∧ Associated x y"

(* Explanation 2: The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. Possession x ∧ Lady y ∧ Book z ∧ Associated y z ⟶ Possesses y z"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ Frame y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair e ∧ Red e ∧ Wicker e ∧ Peruses x e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ While e x"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, glasses, photo album, chair, and perusing event. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "PhotoAlbum z" and "Chair e" and "Peruses x e" <ATP>
  (* We know that the lady possesses the book she is associated with (A) and the association implies that the lady has the book in her possession (B). *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(The lady possesses the book she is associated with, The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession) *)
  (* Since the lady possesses the book she is associated with, we can infer that the possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book (C). *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, C), Implies(The lady possesses the book she is associated with, The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book) *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that there is a lady with a book. *)
  then have "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
