(* Explanation 1: If the people are near the stand they are outside it *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. People x ∧ People y ∧ Stand e ∧ Near x e ⟶ Outside y e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A small ice cream stand with two people standing near it *)
  assumes asm: "Stand x ∧ IceCreamStand x ∧ People y ∧ People e ∧ Standing e ∧ Near y x"
  (* Hypothesis: Two people standing outside an ice cream stand *)
  shows "∃x y e. People x ∧ People y ∧ Stand e ∧ IceCreamStand e ∧ Standing e ∧ Outside y e ∧ At x e ∧ At y e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that there is a stand, ice cream stand, people, and standing near relation. *)
  from asm have "Stand x ∧ IceCreamStand x ∧ People y ∧ People e ∧ Standing e ∧ Near y x" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition Implies(A, B), Implies(the people are near the stand, the people are outside the stand) *)
  (* We can use the explanatory sentence 1 to infer that if people are near the stand, they are outside it. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the people are outside the stand. *)
  then have "Outside y x" <ATP>
  (* We can now combine all the information to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
