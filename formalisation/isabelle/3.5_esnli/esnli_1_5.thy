(* Explanation 1: Experiencing distress is a result of the specific situation where the infant is in a crib and crying *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2 x. Distress e1 ∧ ResultOf e1 e2 ∧ Situation e2 ∧ In e2 Crib ∧ Crying x ∧ Agent x e2 ∧ Infant x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib e ∧ In e Crib ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent x e"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Is e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the infant, crib, crying, and agent. *)
  from asm have "Infant x ∧ Crib e ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent x e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(And(B, C), A), Implies(B & C, experiencing distress) *)
  (* B and C are from the premise, and A is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can infer that the infant is experiencing distress. *)
  then have "Distress e1" for some e1 where "ResultOf e1 e2 ∧ Situation e2 ∧ In e2 Crib ∧ Crying x ∧ Agent x e2 ∧ Infant x" <ATP>
  (* The hypothesis states that a baby is unhappy. *)
  (* Unhappy is a result of distress, so we can conclude that the baby is unhappy. *)
  then have "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Is e ∧ Agent e x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
