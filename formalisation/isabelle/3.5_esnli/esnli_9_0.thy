(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album which is a type of book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ LookingThrough e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TypeOf y z"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ BlackFramedGlasses y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ RedWickerChair e ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In x e"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, black framed glasses, photo album, red wicker chair, perusing, agent, patient, and location. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ BlackFramedGlasses y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ RedWickerChair e ∧ Peruses e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ In x e" <ATP>
  (* The premise does not directly provide information about the lady or a book. *)
  (* However, from explanatory sentence 1, we know that the lady is looking through a photo album which is a type of book. *)
  (* This implies that the lady is with a book. *)
  from explanation_1 obtain a b c where "Lady a ∧ PhotoAlbum b ∧ Book c ∧ LookingThrough d ∧ Agent d a ∧ Patient d b ∧ TypeOf b c" <ATP>
  then have "Lady a ∧ Book c ∧ With a c" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
