(* Explanation 1: In red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Red x ∧ Makeup x ⟶ Type x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A festival displays two men dressed in red makeup and costume, while an older man has cream on his face. *)
  assumes asm: "Festival x ∧ Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Red ∧ In z Costume ∧ OlderMan z ∧ HasCream e2 ∧ Agent e2 z"
  (* Hypothesis: Two men are dressed in makeup. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Man x ∧ Man y ∧ Dressed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ In x Makeup"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the men, dressing, and makeup. *)
  from asm have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Red ∧ In z Costume" <ATP>
  (* We know that red makeup is a type of makeup from the explanatory sentence. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence: In red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
  (* Since one of the men is in red makeup, we can infer that he is in makeup. *)
  then have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Makeup ∧ In z Costume" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
