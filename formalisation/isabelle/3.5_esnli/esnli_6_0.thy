(* Explanation 1: Seven men are looking in a train. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x e. Men x ∧ Seven x ∧ Looking e ∧ InTrain e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: Seven men wearing bright orange reflective vests are looking inside the door of a red train. *)
  assumes asm: "Men x ∧ Seven x ∧ Vest y ∧ Orange y ∧ Reflective y ∧ Looking e ∧ Inside e ∧ Door z ∧ RedTrain z ∧ Of e z"
  (* Hypothesis: A group of men are looking in a train. *)
  shows "∃x e. MenGroup x ∧ Looking e ∧ InTrain e"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about men, seven, looking, inside, door, red train. *)
  from asm have "Men x ∧ Seven x ∧ Looking e ∧ Inside e ∧ Door z ∧ RedTrain z" by meson
  (* From the explanatory sentence 1, we know that seven men are looking in a train. *)
  (* We can infer MenGroup x, Looking e, and InTrain e from the premise and the explanatory sentence. *)
  then have "MenGroup x ∧ Looking e ∧ InTrain e" sledgehammer
