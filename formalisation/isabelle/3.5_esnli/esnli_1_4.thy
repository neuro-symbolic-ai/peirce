(* Explanation 1: When an infant is experiencing distress, it implies that the infant is in a state of discomfort due to the specific situation of being in a crib and crying. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e1 e2 e3. Infant x ∧ Distress e1 ∧ Experiencing e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ StateOfDiscomfort e3 ∧ In e3 x Crib ∧ Crying e3 ∧ In e3 x Crib ∧ DueTo e3 Situation"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ In e x Crib ∧ Crying e ∧ In e x Crib"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy. *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can see that the infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  from asm have "Infant x ∧ In e x Crib ∧ Crying e ∧ In e x Crib" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(infant is experiencing distress, infant is in a state of discomfort due to the specific situation of being in a crib and crying) *)
  (* We can infer that the infant is experiencing distress from the premise. *)
  then have "Infant x ∧ Distress e1 ∧ Experiencing e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ StateOfDiscomfort e3 ∧ In e3 x Crib ∧ Crying e3 ∧ In e3 x Crib ∧ DueTo e3 Situation" sledgehammer
  (* The hypothesis involves a baby being unhappy, which is not directly given in the premise or explanation. *)
  (* We cannot directly infer the hypothesis from the given information. *)
  (* Additional information or axioms are needed to establish a connection between the distress and being unhappy. *)
  (* The proof cannot be completed with the current information. *)
