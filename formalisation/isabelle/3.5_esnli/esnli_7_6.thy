(* Explanation 1: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner, where the action of directing is a part of the process of herding in the context of an event. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Involves e y Directing ∧ PartOf y Directing ∧ Specific Directing ∧ Agent Directing x ∧ Patient Directing y ∧ Context e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through the specific action of directing them, which is a crucial aspect of the herding process. *)

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In e y"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the policeman, crowd, people, walking, and directing. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that herding involves directing pedestrians. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, B), Implies(Action of directing is a part of the process of herding in the context of an event, Directing pedestrians in a specific manner) *)
  (* Since we have Directing e, we can infer Directing pedestrians in a specific manner. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Involves e y Directing" <ATP>
  (* We also know from explanatory sentence 2 that the presence and involvement of pedestrians in herding is manifested through directing them. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(E, C), Implies(Manifestation of the presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding through the specific action of directing them, Presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding) *)
  (* Since we have Directing e, we can infer Presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Presence e y" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
