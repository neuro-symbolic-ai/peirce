(* Explanation 1: If an infant is in a crib and crying, it implies that the infant is unhappy, specifically indicating that the infant is experiencing distress *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e1 e2. Infant x ∧ Crib e1 ∧ In e1 x ∧ Crying e2 ∧ In e2 x ⟶ (Unhappy e2 ∧ Distress e2)"

(* Explanation 2: The specific situation of an infant being in a crib and crying directly indicates that the infant is unhappy and in a state of discomfort *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x e1 e2. Infant x ∧ Crib e1 ∧ In e1 x ∧ Crying e2 ∧ In e2 x ⟶ (Unhappy e2 ∧ Discomfort e2)"

(* Explanation 3: When an infant is in a crib and crying, it indicates that the infant is unhappy and in need of attention *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x e1 e2. Infant x ∧ Crib e1 ∧ In e1 x ∧ Crying e2 ∧ In e2 x ⟶ (Unhappy e2 ∧ NeedAttention e2)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib e1 ∧ In e1 x ∧ Crying e2 ∧ In e2 x"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that the infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  from asm have "Infant x ∧ Crib e1 ∧ In e1 x ∧ Crying e2 ∧ In e2 x" <ATP>
  (* Using Explanation 1, we can infer that the infant is unhappy and experiencing distress. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "Unhappy e2 ∧ Distress e2" <ATP>
  (* Since the infant is unhappy, we can conclude that the baby is also unhappy. *)
  then have "Baby x ∧ Unhappy e2" <ATP>
  (* We can introduce an event where the agent of the event is the baby. *)
  then have "∃e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
