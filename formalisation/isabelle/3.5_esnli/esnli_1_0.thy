(* Explanation 1: If the infant is crying, it can be assumed that they are unhappy. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e1 e2. Infant x ∧ Crying e1 ∧ Unhappy e2 ⟶ (Agent e1 x ∧ Agent e2 x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib y ∧ In x y ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy. *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about the infant, crib, in, crying, and agent. *)
  from asm have "Infant x ∧ Crib y ∧ In x y ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x" by simp
  (* There is an explanatory sentence that states if the infant is crying, then they are unhappy. *)
  (* We can use this to infer that the infant is unhappy. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "Unhappy e" sledgehammer
  (* We can then conclude that the baby is unhappy. *)
  then have "Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
