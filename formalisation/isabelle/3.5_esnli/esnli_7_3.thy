(* Explanation 1: Pedestrians are the entities being herded in the context of herding pedestrians. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Pedestrians x ⟶ Herded x"

(* Explanation 2: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Herding x ⟶ Directing x"

(* Explanation 3: The action of herding pedestrians implies the presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀e x. Herding e ⟶ (Agent e x ∧ Pedestrians x)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the policeman, crowd, people, walking, directing, agent, and patient. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(Herding pedestrians, Directing pedestrians in a specific manner) *)
  (* We have Directing e, which implies Herding e. *)
  from explanation_2 and asm have "Herding e" sledgehammer
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, D), Implies(Herding pedestrians, Presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event) *)
  (* We have Herding e, which implies Pedestrians y. *)
  from explanation_3 and asm have "Pedestrians y" <ATP>
  (* We have gathered all the necessary components for the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
