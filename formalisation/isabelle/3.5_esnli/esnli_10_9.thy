(* Explanation 1: If someone is in red makeup, then they are dressed in makeup. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. InRedMakeup x ⟶ (Dressed e ∧ InMakeup e ∧ Agent e x)"

(* Explanation 2: If someone is in red makeup, then they are dressed in makeup. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. InRedMakeup x ⟶ DressedInMakeup x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A festival displays two men dressed in red makeup and costume, while an older man has cream on his face. *)
  assumes asm: "Festival x ∧ Man y ∧ Man z ∧ DressedInRedMakeup y ∧ Costume w ∧ Displays e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ HasCream e2 ∧ Agent e2 v ∧ Patient e2 v"
  (* Hypothesis: Two men are dressed in makeup. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Man x ∧ Man y ∧ Dressed e ∧ InMakeup e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the festival, men, red makeup, costume, displays, and cream. *)
  from asm have "Festival x ∧ Man y ∧ Man z ∧ DressedInRedMakeup y ∧ Costume w ∧ Displays e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z ∧ HasCream e2 ∧ Agent e2 v ∧ Patient e2 v" by blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(someone is in red makeup, someone is dressed in makeup) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* We already have DressedInRedMakeup y, so we can infer Dressed y. *)
  then have "Man y ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ InMakeup e1 ∧ Agent e1 y" sledgehammer
  (* Similarly, we can infer Dressed z. *)
  then have "Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ InMakeup e1 ∧ Agent e1 z" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we have two men dressed in makeup. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
