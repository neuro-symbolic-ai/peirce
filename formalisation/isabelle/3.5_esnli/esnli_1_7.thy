(* Explanation 1: Experiencing distress leads to the state of being unhappy in the individual involved *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e1 e2. Distress x ∧ Unhappy y ∧ Involved e1 ⟶ (Leads e2 ∧ Cause e2 x ∧ Effect e2 y)"

(* Explanation 2: Unhappiness is a consequence of the individual experiencing distress *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Unhappy x ∧ Distress y ∧ Individual e ⟶ (Consequence ∧ Cause e y ∧ Effect e x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib y ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about the infant, crib, crying, and agent. *)
  from asm have "Infant x" and "Crib y" and "Crying e" and "Agent e x" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(Experiencing distress, Being unhappy in the individual involved) *)
  (* A is Experiencing distress, B is Being unhappy in the individual involved. *)
  (* We can infer that the infant experiencing distress leads to being unhappy in the individual involved. *)
  then have "Unhappy e" <ATP>
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(Being unhappy in the individual involved, Unhappiness) *)
  (* B is Being unhappy in the individual involved, C is Unhappiness. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the baby is unhappy. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
