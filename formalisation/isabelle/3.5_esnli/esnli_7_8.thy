(* Explanation 1: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner, where the action of directing is a part of the process of herding in the context of an event. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ InvolvedIn e y ∧ PartOf e e Herding ∧ ContextOf e e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through the specific action of directing them, which is a crucial aspect of the herding process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ InvolvedIn e y ∧ ManifestedThrough e e ∧ CrucialAspectOf e e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ AdverbialModifier e z"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the policeman, crowd of people, walking, and directing. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition B: Directing pedestrians in a specific manner. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 1, we know that Directing is part of the process of Herding. *)
  (* Therefore, if someone is Directing, they are also Herding. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* We also have the logical proposition C: Presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding. *)
  (* From explanatory sentence 2, we know that the presence and involvement of pedestrians in herding is manifested through directing. *)
  (* Since the policeman is directing the crowd of people, it implies that the crowd of people are involved in the herding event. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
