(* Explanation 1: A photo album is a type of book, implying that looking through a photo album is equivalent to looking through a book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. PhotoAlbum x ⟶ Book x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ BlackFramedGlasses y ∧ Peruses e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Sitting e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ In x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, perusing, agent, patient, photo album, chair, and sitting. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "Peruses e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e z" and "PhotoAlbum z" and "Chair w" and "Sitting e2" and "Agent e2 x" apply blast
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(a photo album is a type of book, looking through a book) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from the derived implication Implies(A, C) *)
  (* We already have PhotoAlbum z, so we can infer Book z. *)
  then have "Woman x ∧ Book z" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* We can introduce a new variable y for z. *)
  then obtain y where "Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y" using assms apply blast
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
