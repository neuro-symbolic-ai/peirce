(* Explanation 1: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner, where the action of directing is a part of the process of herding in the context of an event. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ PartOf e Herding ∧ Involves e Directing ∧ Specific e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through the specific action of directing them, which is a crucial aspect of the herding process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ Involvement e ∧ Presence e ∧ Manifested e ∧ CrucialAspect e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ AdverbialModifier e z"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the policeman, crowd of people, walking, directing, agent, patient, and adverbial modifier. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ AdverbialModifier e z" <ATP>
  (* We have the explanatory sentences related to herding, directing, involvement, presence, manifested, and crucial aspect. *)
  (* From Explanation 1, we know that herding involves directing in a specific manner. *)
  (* We can infer that if there is directing, then there is herding. *)
  from explanation_1 and ‹Directing e› have "Herding e" <ATP>
  (* We also know that the involvement and presence of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through directing. *)
  (* From Explanation 2, we can infer that if there is involvement, presence, manifested, and crucial aspect, then there is herding. *)
  from explanation_2 and ‹Involvement e› and ‹Presence e› and ‹Manifested e› and ‹CrucialAspect e› have "Herding e" <ATP>
  (* Combining the above inferences, we can conclude that if there is directing, involvement, presence, manifested, and crucial aspect, then there is herding. *)
  then have "Herding e" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, we can derive the hypothesis that a policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
