(* Explanation 1: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner, where the action of directing is a part of the process of herding in the context of an event. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ PartOf e Herding ∧ Involves e Directing ∧ Specific e"

(* Explanation 2: The presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through the specific action of directing them, which is a crucial aspect of the herding process. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Directing e ∧ Involvement e y ∧ Manifested e ∧ Crucial e"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In e y"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the policeman, crowd, people, walking, and directing. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ Crowd y ∧ People z ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  (* We have the logical proposition A: Herding pedestrians involves directing pedestrians in a specific manner. *)
  (* From the premise, we know that the policeman is directing, which is part of herding. *)
  (* We also have the logical proposition B: The presence and involvement of pedestrians in the event of herding is manifested through the specific action of directing them. *)
  (* This implies that the presence and involvement of pedestrians in the herding event is crucial. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that the policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ Herding e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
