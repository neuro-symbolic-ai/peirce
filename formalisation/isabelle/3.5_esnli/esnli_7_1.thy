(* Explanation 1: Directing a crowd of people is another expression of herding pedestrians. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀e1 e2. Directing e1 ∧ CrowdOfPeople e2 ⟷ HerdingPedestrians e1 ∧ Patient e1 e2"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A policeman is directing a crowd of people walking. *)
  assumes asm: "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Manner e z"
  (* Hypothesis: A policeman is herding pedestrians. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ HerdingPedestrians e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can get known information about the policeman, crowd of people, walking, directing, agent, patient, and manner. *)
  from asm have "Policeman x ∧ CrowdOfPeople y ∧ Walking z ∧ Directing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Manner e z" by blast
  (* There is an equivalent relation between directing a crowd of people and herding pedestrians. *)
  (* There is a derived implication Implies(A, B), Implies(directing a crowd of people, herding pedestrians) *)
  (* We can infer herding pedestrians from directing a crowd of people. *)
  then have "HerdingPedestrians e" using explanation_1 by blast
  (* We also have the information about the policeman and the pedestrians. *)
  then have "Policeman x ∧ Pedestrians y ∧ HerdingPedestrians e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
