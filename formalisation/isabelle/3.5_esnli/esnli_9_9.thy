(* Explanation 1: The possession of the book by the lady is a direct consequence of the lady being associated with that specific book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Possession x ∧ Book y ∧ Lady z ∧ Associated z y ∧ DirectConsequence x"

(* Explanation 2: The possession of the book by the lady is a direct result of the lady having a specific association with that book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Possession x ∧ Book y ∧ Lady z ∧ Association z y ∧ DirectResult x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ BlackFramedGlasses y ∧ Peruses e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ RedWickerChair w ∧ Sitting e ∧ In x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, photo album, and red wicker chair. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "PhotoAlbum z" and "RedWickerChair w" apply auto[1]
  
  (* We know that the possession of the book by the lady is a direct consequence of the lady being associated with that specific book. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, A), Implies(the lady being associated with that specific book, possession of the book by the lady) *)
  (* We can infer that if the lady is associated with a specific book, then she possesses that book. *)
  have "∃y. Book y ∧ Lady x ∧ Associated x y" apply (simp add: assms)
  
  (* Since possession is a direct consequence of association, we can conclude that the lady has a book. *)
  then have "∃y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y" by (simp add: assms)
