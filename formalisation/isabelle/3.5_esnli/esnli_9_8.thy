(* Explanation 1: The lady possesses the book she is associated with, and this association implies that the lady has the book in her possession *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ Possesses x y"

(* Explanation 2: The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Book y ∧ Lady x ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ Possesses x y"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ Frame y ∧ Chair z ∧ Red z ∧ Wicker z ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Peruses z ∧ Agent z x ∧ Patient z y ∧ While x z"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, glasses, chair, and photo album. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "Glasses y" and "Chair z" and "PhotoAlbum z" apply blast
  (* The explanatory sentences 1 and 2 are relevant to infer the hypothesis. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(The lady possesses the book she is associated with, The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession) *)
  (* We can use Equivalent(A, B) to infer B from A. *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, so we can infer B. *)
  from explanation_1 have "∃y. Book y ∧ Lady x ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ Possesses x y" using assms apply auto[1]
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession, The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book) *)
  (* We can use Implies(B, C) to infer C from B. *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 1, so we can infer C. *)
  then have "∃y. Book y ∧ Lady x ∧ AssociatedWith x y ∧ Possesses x y" apply (simp add: assms)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
