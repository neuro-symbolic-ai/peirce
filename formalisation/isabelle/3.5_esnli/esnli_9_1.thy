(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album which is a type of book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TypeOf y z"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ Frame y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair e ∧ Red e ∧ Wicker e ∧ Peruses x ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Sitting x e"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ TypeOf y z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, glasses, photo album, chair, and sitting. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair e ∧ Sitting x e" <ATP>
  (* From the explanation sentence, we know that a photo album is a type of book. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(the lady is looking through a photo album, a photo album is a type of book) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* Since the lady is looking through a photo album, we can infer that there is a lady with a book. *)
  then have "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ TypeOf z y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
