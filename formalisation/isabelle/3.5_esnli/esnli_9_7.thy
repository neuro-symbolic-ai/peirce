(* Explanation 1: The lady possesses the book she is associated with, and this association implies that the lady has the book in her possession. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ Possesses x y ∧ Associated x y"

(* Explanation 2: The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Possession x ⟶ (Association x y ∧ Lady y ∧ Book y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ Frame y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair e ∧ Red e ∧ Wicker e ∧ Peruses x ∧ Agent x x ∧ Patient x z ∧ While x e"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, glasses, black frame, photo album, chair, red wicker chair, perusing, agent, patient, and while sitting. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "Glasses y" and "Black y" and "Frame y" and "PhotoAlbum z" and "Chair e" and "Red e" and "Wicker e" and "Peruses x" and "Agent x x" and "Patient x z" and "While x e" <ATP>
  (* We know from explanatory sentence 1 that the lady possesses the book she is associated with. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Equivalent(A, B), Equivalent(The lady possesses the book she is associated with, The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession) *)
  (* We can infer that the lady has the book in her possession. *)
  then have "Lady x ∧ Book y" <ATP>
  (* Since the lady has the book in her possession, we can conclude that the possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession, The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book) *)
  (* Therefore, we can deduce that the lady is associated with the book. *)
  then have "With x y" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
