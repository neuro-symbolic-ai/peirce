(* Explanation 1: The lady possesses the book she is associated with, and this association implies that the lady has the book in her possession. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ Associated x y ∧ Possesses x y"

(* Explanation 2: The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∃x y z. Possesses x y ∧ Book y ∧ Lady z ∧ Associated z y ∧ ResultOf x z"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ Frame y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair e ∧ Red e ∧ Wicker e ∧ Peruses x e ∧ Agent x e ∧ Patient e z ∧ While e x"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, glasses, photo album, chair, and perusing. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "PhotoAlbum z" and "Chair e" and "Peruses x e" <ATP>
  (* From the premise, we can also infer that the woman is associated with the book. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(The lady possesses the book she is associated with, The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession) *)
  (* A is from explanatory sentence 1, B is from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* We can conclude that the lady has the book in her possession. *)
  then obtain a where "Lady x ∧ Book a ∧ Associated x a ∧ Possesses x a" <ATP>
  (* The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(B, C), Implies(The association implies that the lady has the book in her possession, The possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book) *)
  (* B is from explanatory sentence 2, C is from explanatory sentence 2. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that the possession of the book by the lady is a result of the specific association between the lady and the book. *)
  then obtain b where "Possesses x b ∧ Book b ∧ Lady x ∧ Associated x b ∧ ResultOf b x" <ATP>
  (* We have shown that the lady has the book in her possession, which means there is a lady with a book. *)
  then have "Lady x ∧ Book b ∧ With x b" by auto
  then show ?thesis by auto
