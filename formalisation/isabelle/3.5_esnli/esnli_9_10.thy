(* Explanation 1: The possession of the book by the lady is a direct consequence of the lady being associated with that specific book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Possession x y ∧ Lady y ∧ Associated y x ⟶ DirectConsequence x"

(* Explanation 2: The possession of the book by the lady is a direct result of the lady having a specific association with that book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Possession x y ∧ Lady y ∧ Association y x ⟶ DirectResult x"

(* Explanation 3: If the lady is associated with a specific book, then she possesses that book. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ Associated x y ⟶ Possesses x y"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair. *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ BlackFramedGlasses y ∧ Peruses e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Sitting x Chair ∧ RedWickerChair Chair"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book. *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, perusing, agent, patient, photo album, and sitting in a chair. *)
  from asm have "Woman x" and "Peruses e" and "Agent e x" and "Patient e z" and "PhotoAlbum z" and "Sitting x Chair" apply auto[1]
  (* Since the woman is perusing a photo album, she is associated with that specific book. *)
  from `Peruses e` and `Patient e z` have "Association x z" using assms apply auto[1]
  (* According to Explanation 3, if the lady is associated with a specific book, then she possesses that book. *)
  from `Woman x` and `Association x z` and `PhotoAlbum z` have "Possesses x z" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* Possessing the book implies being associated with that specific book. *)
  then have "Associated x z" apply (simp add: assms)
  (* From Explanation 1, the possession of the book by the lady is a direct consequence of the lady being associated with that specific book. *)
  then have "DirectConsequence x" using assms apply auto[1]
  (* Since DirectConsequence x holds, the lady possesses the book. *)
  then have "Possession x z" by (simp add: assms)
  (* According to Explanation 3, if the lady possesses a book, then she is associated with that book. *)
  then have "Association x z" sledgehammer
  (* From Explanation 2, the possession of the book by the lady is a direct result of the lady having a specific association with that book. *)
  then have "DirectResult x" <ATP>
  (* Since DirectResult x holds, the lady has a specific association with that book. *)
  then have "C x" <ATP>
  (* Therefore, there exists a lady x with a book z. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
