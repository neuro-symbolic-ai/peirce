(* Explanation 1: In red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. Red x ∧ Makeup x ⟶ TypeOf x Makeup"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A festival displays two men dressed in red makeup and costume, while an older man has cream on his face. *)
  assumes asm: "Festival x ∧ Man y ∧ Man z ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y Red ∧ In z Costume ∧ Display e2 ∧ Patient e2 y ∧ Patient e2 z ∧ OlderMan z ∧ Has e2 ∧ Patient e2 Cream ∧ On z Face"
  (* Hypothesis: Two men are dressed in makeup. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Man x ∧ Man y ∧ Dressed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ In x Makeup"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the men, red makeup, costume, and cream. *)
  from asm have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ In y Red ∧ In z Costume ∧ OlderMan z ∧ Patient e2 Cream" <ATP>
  (* We know that red makeup is a type of makeup from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* There is an explanatory sentence 1: "In red makeup is a type of makeup." *)
  (* Since one of the men is in red makeup, we can infer that he is dressed in makeup. *)
  then have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ In y Makeup" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
