(* Explanation 1: Experiencing distress leads to the state of being unhappy in the individual involved. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e1 e2. Distress x ∧ Involved e1 ∧ Unhappy e2 ⟶ (Lead e1 ∧ Patient e1 x ∧ StateOf e2 ∧ In e2 x)"

(* Explanation 2: Unhappiness is a consequence of the individual experiencing distress. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. Unhappy x ∧ Distress y ∧ Individual e ⟶ (Consequence e ∧ Patient e e x ∧ Cause e y)"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: An infant is in a crib and crying. *)
  assumes asm: "Infant x ∧ Crib y ∧ Crying e ∧ Agent e x ∧ In x y"
  (* Hypothesis: A baby is unhappy. *)
  shows "∃x e. Baby x ∧ Unhappy e ∧ Agent e x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the infant, crib, crying, and agent. *)
  from asm have "Infant x" and "Crib y" and "Crying e" and "Agent e x" <ATP>
  (* We know that the infant is involved in the event of crying. *)
  have "Involved e" <ATP>
  (* From the premise and the fact that the infant is involved in crying, we can infer that the infant is unhappy. *)
  have "Unhappy x" <ATP>
  (* Since the infant is unhappy, we can conclude that the infant is a baby. *)
  have "Baby x" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can establish the existence of a baby who is unhappy and has the agent as the baby itself. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
