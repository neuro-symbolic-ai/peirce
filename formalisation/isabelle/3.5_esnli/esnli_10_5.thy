(* Explanation 1: In red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. RedMakeup x ⟶ Makeup x"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: A festival displays two men dressed in red makeup and costume, while an older man has cream on his face. *)
  assumes asm: "Festival x ∧ Man y ∧ Man z ∧ OlderMan w ∧ Dressed e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Agent e1 z ∧ In y RedMakeup ∧ In z RedMakeup ∧ Costume v ∧ In v y ∧ CreamOnFace e2 ∧ Agent e2 w"
  (* Hypothesis: Two men are dressed in makeup. *)
  shows "∃x y e. Man x ∧ Man y ∧ Dressed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Agent e y ∧ In x Makeup ∧ In y Makeup"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the information about the men, red makeup, costume, and cream on face. *)
  from asm have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ In y RedMakeup ∧ In z RedMakeup ∧ Costume v" <ATP>
  (* We know that red makeup is a type of makeup from explanatory sentence 1. *)
  (* There is a logical proposition A: red makeup is a type of makeup. *)
  (* Since both y and z are in red makeup, we can infer that they are dressed in makeup. *)
  then have "Man y ∧ Man z ∧ In y Makeup ∧ In z Makeup" <ATP>
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
