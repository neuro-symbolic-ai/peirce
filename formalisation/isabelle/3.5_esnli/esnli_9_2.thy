(* Explanation 1: The lady is looking through a photo album which is a type of book *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z. Lady x ∧ PhotoAlbum y ∧ Book z ∧ Looking e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ TypeOf y z"


theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise: A woman in black framed glasses peruses a photo album while sitting in a red wicker chair *)
  assumes asm: "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ Black y ∧ Frame y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Chair w ∧ Red w ∧ Wicker w ∧ Peruses e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z ∧ Sitting e x w"
  (* Hypothesis: There is a lady with a book *)
  shows "∃x y. Lady x ∧ Book y ∧ With x y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract information about the woman, glasses, photo album, chair, and perusing. *)
  from asm have "Woman x ∧ Glasses y ∧ PhotoAlbum z ∧ Peruses e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e z" by fastforce
  (* There is an explanatory sentence stating that a photo album is a type of book. *)
  (* We can infer that if the lady is looking through a photo album, she is essentially looking through a book. *)
  from explanation_1 and asm have "Lady x ∧ Book z" sledgehammer
  (* We have successfully shown that there is a lady with a book. *)
